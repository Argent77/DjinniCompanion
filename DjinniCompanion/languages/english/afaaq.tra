@10000 = ~Yes, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? Do you want something from me?~
@10001 = ~Please return me from whence I came.~
@10002 = ~I will talk to you later.~
@10003 = ~I am sorry, <GABBER>. But I will only answer to <CHARNAME>.~
@10004 = ~You hold the lamp in your hands. A few moments later it starts to emit a faint pulsating light and the djinni turns his attention to you.~
@10005 = ~When he realizes that you are not <CHARNAME>, he retreats back into the lamp, and a short while later the glow disappears.~
@10006 = ~Greetings, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. May I help you with something?~
@10007 = ~How are you doing, everything okay in there?~
@10008 = ~Can you grant me a wish?~
@10009 = ~Would you please come out of your lamp?~
@10010 = ~Can you tell me something about yourself?~
@10011 = ~Do you have any advice for me?~
@10012 = ~I just want to make sure you are still in there. Goodbye.~
@10013 = ~May I help you with something else?~
@10014 = ~That's all for now. Goodbye.~
@10015 = ~How do you feel with your body whole again?~
@10016 = ~You are poisoned. Do you need a cure?~
@10017 = ~You are diseased. Do you need a cure?~
@10018 = ~You are hurt. Do you need a healing potion?~
@10019 = ~Would you like to have healing potions for emergency situations?~
@10020 = ~Please don't engage in battle.~
@10021 = ~Please engage in battle again.~
@10022 = ~Please return into your lamp.~
@10023 = ~I'd like to access your inventory again.~
@10024 = ~Afaaq, how do you manage to enter the lamp, even though you are carrying big swords and the like?~
@10025 = ~Can you tell me about your abilities?~
@10026 = ~I'm curious, Afaaq. What does the interior of your lamp look like?~
@10027 = ~I'd like to enter your lamp again.~
@10028 = ~You are behaving oddly. Care to fix it?~
@10029 = ~I'll talk to you later.~
@10031 = ~Do you want something else from me?~
@10032 = ~Thanks for asking, but I am fine. How are you today?~
@10033 = ~I'm feeling great today.~
@10034 = ~I'm well enough.~
@10035 = ~Not so good.~
@10036 = ~I'm feeling miserable.~
@10037 = ~That is good to hear.~
@10038 = ~I hope you get better soon.~
@10039 = ~I am sorry to hear.~
@10040 = ~I feel very good, thanks to you. I will accompany you as long as you wish.~
@10041 = ~I feel very good, thanks to you. But I will return to my home plane after you have gotten your soul back.~
@10042 = ~Hmm, let me think...~
@10043 = ~If you ever face an overwhelming number of opponents, know that the classic divide and conquer strategy can help you tremendously.~
@10044 = ~Thanks for your advice.~
@10045 = ~Even the most heavily armed opponents will be powerless before you if you can hinder their movements.~
@10046 = ~Be careful when fighting extraplanar creatures. Many of them can see through your illusions and have special powers you do not expect.~
@10047 = ~Outsiders like myself or the efreets can temporarily change their physical appearance to recover their health when they are badly hurt. I advise you to hit them hard and fast, it may also help to hinder them in their movements.~
@10048 = ~Do not depend on your spells to silence enemy spellcasters. There is always a way to counteract their muted state.~
@10049 = ~Spellcasters are usually lacking constitution or stamina to withstand physical attacks. It is always good practice to be prepared all the time, be it against overwhelming forces or the unseen dagger in the dark.~
@10050 = ~Your thieves will have a hard time sneaking up on your targets without shadows in their reach.~
@10051 = ~Daylight is the natural enemy of the undead. Whenever you plan to defeat them, use it to your advantage.~
@10052 = ~The nights harbor more than zombies or skeletons. Even the shadows may come alive in the forsaken corners of the world.~
@10053 = ~Do not suppose that the darkness impairs your opponents. Many of them can see in the dark quite well, even better than you can.~
@10054 = ~Be aware that you can not always flee from overwhelming forces like you can in open terrain. Make sure you are well prepared before you enter the fray.~
@10055 = ~Traps are very common in places like this. Your thief should always watch out for them.~
@10056 = ~You are not the only adventurer who is marching through a place like this. Do not be disappointed if you merely find empty treasure chests.~
@10057 = ~All kinds of creatures call places like this their home. Do not be surprised to encounter a wide range of monsters.~
@10058 = ~Forest creatures are usually not evil by themselves. You can avoid many unpleasant encounters if you do not disturb them in their activities.~
@10059 = ~Sentient beings like dryads or nymphs can be found in a forest like this. It is usually up to you how they will treat you.~
@10060 = ~Take care, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Many adventurers have met an untimely end against the more unnatural beasts which make their home in the darker corners of the woods.~
@10061 = ~You are probably referring to the lycanthropes? I've had my share of trouble with them already.~
@10062 = ~Do you mean werewolves? I've had my share of trouble with them already.~
@10063 = ~What are you talking about?~
@10064 = ~I can take care of myself, Afaaq.~
@10065 = ~Oh, you have already encountered them? Take care of their bites and scratches, however. They are the primary way to infect others with their curse.~
@10066 = ~Yes, I am talking about lycanthropes. Werewolves are the most common example, I presume. Take care of their bites and scratches: they are the primary way to infect others with their curse.~
@10067 = ~I am talking about lycanthropes, usually in the form of werewolves. You may also encounter types like werebears, wererats or weretigers. However, do not mistake the latter with the despicable rakshasa.~
@10068 = ~You should also take care of their bites and scratches: they are the primary way to infect others with their curse.~
@10069 = ~If you say so...~
@10070 = ~Cities tend to be melting pots for a multitude of different cultures and customs. Do not be surprised if your actions will please one group and anger another one at the same time.~
@10071 = ~Crime and corruption flourish in cities like this. You will see it for yourself if you visit the darker corners at night.~
@10072 = ~You can purchase a lot of magical equipment in towns like this. However, to get your hands on more powerful artifacts, you will usually have to pay more than just money.~
@10073 = ~Take care when dealing with the authorities of the cities. The minds of mortals tend to be corrupted by the powers granted by their positions.~
@10074 = ~The Athkatlans seem to be very sure of their own defences. Not all cities allow bands of adventurers to pass the city gates at night.~
@10075 = ~The City Gates are usually a place where you can meet a lot of merchants and travellers. In Athkatla this seems not to be the case.~
@10076 = ~The stench is overwhelming, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Only the most degenerated undead creatures will make this cave their home.~
@10077 = ~I can sense an unusual menacing force close by. It is almost of...divine nature?~
@10078 = ~This part of the sewers harbors more than strange cults and monsters. I can sense an evil aura of great power.~
@10079 = ~Abandoned and foul places like this can harbor beasts you may not have seen outside of your nightmares.~
@10080 = ~Beholders are fearsome beasts which you should avoid at all costs. Even their less powerful kin, the gauth, are not to be taken lightly in battle.~
@10081 = ~I can almost feel the criminal acts taking place in the streets. The dead bodies floating in the sea confirm my suspicions.~
@10082 = ~I am certain you can purchase *anything* in this part of the city.~
@10083 = ~This is an unusual place, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I can feel powerful enchantments, however I do not recognize their nature. Strange...~
@10084 = ~What an oppressive aura; it almost overwhelms my senses. Whatever lies hidden in this place is powerful and far more ancient than the town itself.~
@10085 = ~Ah yes, the slums. I have the feeling that every human settlement has at least one place to dump the poor and the desperate.~
@10086 = ~I doubt you can purchase high quality wares in these parts of the town. However, you will likely have more luck if you are looking for the more ethically questionable products mortals would sell.~
@10087 = ~What a strange place you have brought me to, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I can feel an otherworldly presence in the immediate vicinity, however I do not recognize its source.~
@10088 = ~I would not have thought it possible, but this construct is of human design. I have never seen such powerful magic woven into a structure to withstand the raw dimensional forces.~
@10089 = ~Take care, there is no way to know what creatures have made the sphere their home.~
@10090 = ~This is a pocket plane of some sort and appears to be connected to a layer of the Abyss. You will likely encounter all kinds of demonic creatures, be they as harmless as a quasit or as dangerous as a tanar'ri.~
@10091 = ~I suggest that you complete your task as fast as possible. You will never know when a greater demonic power will lay its eyes on this wondrous sphere.~
@10092 = ~This place reminds me a bit of the streets of Calimport. You can hear the town criers shouting the latest gossip, see exotic merchants offering their wares and smell the food and drink from the taverns.~
@10093 = ~The townsfolk appear to be a bit tense, I wonder why...~
@10094 = ~This place appears to be an artificial pocket plane of some sorts. It is probably shielded by powerful enchantments too, so an escape is very unlikely.~
@10095 = ~A prison has always wardens or supervisors. Maybe they know more about the people you are looking for.~
@10096 = ~The stench of evil is almost palpable in this place. I can only advise you to prepare for the worst.~
@10097 = ~I know this kind of magic very well. It is of djinn design and very powerful.~
@10098 = ~Can't you do something about it?~
@10099 = ~That's good to know, but it doesn't get me anywhere.~
@10100 = ~No, I can not. There are rules which forbid outsiders to interfere with deals between mortals and djinns.~
@10101 = ~You have to find a way to solve the puzzle for yourself. My intervention would do more harm than good in the end.~
@10102 = ~Unfortunately I can not help you in this case directly. I can only advise you to find the mortal responsible for this illusion and deal with him or her personally.~
@10103 = ~These illusions are impressive indeed. Only a djinni of great power is able to alter reality to such an extent.~
@10104 = ~The circus is free to entertain the people once more.~
@10105 = ~How the gnome was able to make a wish of this grand scale will always be a mystery.~
@10106 = ~How the gnome was able to make a wish of this grand scale is astounding. Maybe we will find it out in time.~
@10107 = ~It is a pity, however, that our gnome met his end in such a sad fashion. In the end he was nothing more than a plaything for the despicable rakshasa.~
@10108 = ~This is an impressive marketplace. However, it does not even come close to the grandeur with which markets present themselves in Calimshan cities.~
@10109 = ~Marketplaces like this have much to offer to a successful adventurer like you. However, the wares will cost you an arm and a leg, too.~
@10110 = ~Is this the dark side of the Temple District? I do not sense unusual magical activities. However, I expect a lot of the less-reputable townsfolk to make their appearance now and then.~
@10111 = ~You have entered the home of a wizard, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I advise you to be courteous unless you are eager for a fight.~
@10112 = ~Take care, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, the residents of this place are very powerful. I can almost smell the stench of their evil minds.~
@10113 = ~Is this a place where they store your body after it ceases to function?~
@10114 = ~The dead are restless... I can sense a malevolent power defiling their resting places.~
@10115 = ~This place appears to be far older than the buildings above it. I can sense a multitude of creatures crawling around the dark corners of this place.~
@10116 = ~The lavish adornments and the stale air suggest this crypt is even older than the labyrinth which leads to it. Places like this are always guarded by undead of some kind.~
@10117 = ~The place is teeming with undead, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I hope you have brought enough stakes or holy water with you?~
@10118 = ~Is this a sanctuary to reflect and contemplate? More likely a stage to show off and brag about. I wonder what your gods may think about places like this?~
@10119 = ~I can see why Athkatla is called the "City of Coin". While your streets may not be paved with gold, the wealth showed off by your churches would have every god go green with envy.~
@10120 = ~Did you know that Athkatla was founded by Calishite emigrants? The obsession for wealth and a decadent lifestyle has always been an important cornerstone of Calimshan.~
@10121 = ~I have heard that the Athkatlan council members are not known to the public. That is very unusual for a city which attaches so much importance to financial wealth. How do the people know whom to bribe?~
@10122 = ~A rural settlement on the fringes of Amn. I doubt you will find world-threatening dangers and heroic quests in a place like this.~
@10123 = ~This land appears to be wilder and more detached from the usual Amnish countryside. I suggest that you scout the surroundings carefully before you advance.~
@10124 = ~This complex appears to have been constructed in ancient times. The design is almost familiar...maybe it has been influenced by one of the former Calishite tribes.~
@10125 = ~I can feel a frightening power lurking somewhere in this dungeon. Step carefully, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I can only guess how many ancient and powerful creatures have made this place their home.~
@10126 = ~This unnatural darkness emanates from a place very near. I can almost feel the evil which is responsible for it.~
@10127 = ~The whole region has been infested by a dark mind. Do not stay too long or you too will fall prey to its powers.~
@10128 = ~The whole complex has been corrupted to the core. Do not trust your eyes alone or you will be easy prey to the darkness which lingers in every corner.~
@10129 = ~The whole dungeon reeks of perverted magic. This place became corrupted even long before the darkness had taken over.~
@10130 = ~This is a wild and uncivilized place, even by human standards. I wonder why the Cowled Wizards have chosen a place like this.~
@10131 = ~I can feel magical energies lingering around somewhere. However I am not sure whether it is a natural phenomenon or caused by arcane powers.~
@10132 = ~The magic of the land is powerful, I can feel it. You will likely encounter many strong beasts which make this grove their home.~
@10133 = ~So, you have destroyed a pack of dao genies to please my captors? I doubt they will take revenge on Trademeet though.~
@10134 = ~However, if they learn of your involvement in the imprisonment of their leader, you will be in big trouble. You have never seen an enraged group of daos seeking revenge before.~
@10135 = ~The town looks peaceful on the surface, however the people seem troubled. Places like this are great opportunities for adventurers like you to earn money or fame.~
@10136 = ~The Underdark is an extremely dangerous place even for the native inhabitants. A great many dangers lurk behind every corner and the majority of its residents will either capture or kill you on sight.~
@10137 = ~You will find naught to eat but poisonous fungi, unless you are lucky to find peaceful traders or fellow adventurers. I advise you to make haste and find a way out as soon as possible.~
@10138 = ~One of the greatest dangers you will likely encounter are raiding parties of drow. They appear harmless enough but their magic is powerful and can overwhelm you in an instant. I have come to know about their cunning and cruelty in the past.~
@10139 = ~The more powerful kind of their species have mastered a great variety of magic spells as well. If you encounter one of them, take it out quickly or you are dead.~
@10140 = ~Always watch your back. Do not trust anyone in this place, as they will take advantage of you the instant they see an opportunity to do so.~
@10141 = ~You are lucky that the drow are preparing for war and are in need of outside help. Under normal circumstances you would have been sold as slaves to one of the ruling houses and your chances to leave the city alive would have been slim at best.~
@10142 = ~I do not know much about the sahuagin, but they are likely in no way inferior to their predatory relatives, the sharks.~
@10143 = ~The only time I have seen them was in the wake of a marid horde, back in the glorious days of the Calim Empire.~
@10144 = ~We are unlucky to have stumbled upon a lair of illithids, also known as mindflayers by your kind.~
@10145 = ~Their powers are terrible especially to yourself, as they will see you only as their next meal or cheap labor.~
@10146 = ~To leave the influence of the illithids, you either have to prove your superiority to them or kill their master brain.~
@10147 = ~If you actually manage to kill their master brain, the remaining forces will likely flee from your presence as they are unable to launch coordinated attacks anymore.~
@10148 = ~Even in this ruined state you can catch a glimpse of the former glory the temple radiated in the past.~
@10149 = ~This looks like a passage to the surface, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I can sense a multitude of monsters, however, which guard it well.~
@10150 = ~If the rumors are true and the drow are at war with their surface cousins, it is unlikely you can pass them easily.~
@10151 = ~Did you see their grim faces, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? The destruction of their temple appears to mean a lot to them. Maybe there is more at stake than they are willing to admit.~
@10152 = ~It pains me to see the wonderful city of Suldanessellar fallen to Irenicus and his minions. Even more so as I can sense the tormentors of my past wrecking chaos in this place.~
@10153 = ~You have to move quickly and put an end to this Irenicus.~
@10154 = ~This Irenicus must have spent a lot of time and resources to bring down a city like this so easily.~
@10155 = ~However, I have the impression that he neglected to strengthen his defence in favor of a quick advance. You should be powerful enough already to deal with the many beasts guarding this place.~
@10156 = ~You are close to your goal, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. This Irenicus is near and I doubt his remaining defences will be much trouble for you.~
@10157 = ~What a surprising situation: even after death this Irenicus does not give up your soul.~
@10158 = ~You should take care, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, both you and the wizard have power in this place. I would not be surprised if he attempts to take control of this plane even as we speak.~
@10159 = ~Where did you take me, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? I have never seen a building like this.~
@10160 = ~There is a mysterious aura around, however I am unable to recognize its nature.~
@10161 = ~Did you see the statues near the portal? I am certain they are the key to open a gate to the next level.~
@10162 = ~These rooms look like an abandoned library. I wonder who applied so much effort into collecting and maintaining all those books, especially in a remote place like this.~
@10163 = ~The teleporters are a nuisance. Without a map we might appear in the Nine Hells itself if we are not careful.~
@10164 = ~Those rooms appear to be laboratories of powerful wizards. Who knows what has led to their demise.~
@10165 = ~I advise you to be very careful, as wizards are not known for letting outsiders look over their shoulder. There may still be insidious traps or magical beasts waiting for you.~
@10166 = ~That Machine of Lum is a curious contraption. The level of madness required to make it work is even beyond my scope.~
@10167 = ~You should take care when dealing with the creatures of this place. Everyone appears to be affected by the infamous Machine of Lum one way or another.~
@10168 = ~This room looks deceptively quiet, <PRO_LADYLORD>. However, we are deep within the keep and beyond the seal a great evil awaits us.~
@10169 = ~I am reasonably sure that a seal of that scale is guarded by horrors beyond your imagination.~
@10170 = ~Very strange, I can detect no evil intent in this room. Did the Imprisoned One already escape?~
@10171 = ~What power...its hatred is overwhelming. My <PRO_LADYLORD>, defeat it quickly or you will perish!~
@10172 = ~Step carefully, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. The air is filled with the stench of illithids or even worse, and I can still feel the tortured minds of mortals echoing in my mind.~
@10173 = ~I can sense only madness and hate in the immediate vicinity, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I fear you will have little success talking to the residents of this room.~
@10174 = ~I am sensing powerful spirits within those stone heads. You should take heed what they have to tell you.~
@10175 = ~I see you have returned to your pocket plane, my <PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@10176 = ~Hmm, this place looks different than before. I guess it resembles your <PRO_RACE> nature more closely now, but it will take some time for your mortal mind to understand it completely.~
@10177 = ~The challenges mentioned by your former adversary are likely formed by your subconscious desire to learn more about your true potential.~
@10178 = ~You have seen for yourself, by overcoming the challenges you are able to set free your true potential. When the time has come you will have another opportunity to learn more about your true self, I am sure of it.~
@10179 = ~The lessons taught to you by the Solar are essential on your way to godhood. How do you expect to take control over your divinity if you do not even know yourself?~
@10180 = ~You are nearing your goal, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I can already feel your divine soul taking form to guide your actions.~
@10181 = ~The time has finally come. You are almost ready to claim your heritage and take over Bhaal's Throne of Blood.~
@10182 = ~Whatever choice you make, I will fight on your side as long as I am able to.~
@10183 = ~The town is already on the brink of destruction. I do not see how you can prevent the inevitable as long as we are confined within, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@10184 = ~The smell of brimstone and ashes is very strong in this region. The Fire Giant Temple will be not far away.~
@10185 = ~This place lives up to its name, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. The temple has been built over a massive magma chamber deep below the mountains. You will find no refuge from the heat here.~
@10186 = ~You have brought us to a dark and foul place, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. The magical energies surrounding the temple ruins feel like stale air.~
@10187 = ~Do you see the masses of soldiers, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? Defeating them all would take weeks. I strongly suggest to concentrate your attacks on Yaga-Shura and his generals. An army without leadership will disperse quickly.~
@10188 = ~This appears to be the heart of the temple. Step carefully, I can sense strong magic guarding this place.~
@10189 = ~Ah, this town reminds me of Calimshan. The blazing heat and dry wind... This will be a good place to restock your supplies and prepare for the coming battles.~
@10190 = ~The townspeople seem to be frightened of something or someone. Maybe you can find a reason for their troubles, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@10191 = ~The entrance to Abazigal's Lair is impressive indeed.~
@10192 = ~We have seen a grand place like this not too long ago, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Do you remember the richly ornamented cave entrance in the Windspear Hills?~
@10193 = ~I am curious about the Bhaalspawn who is living in this place.~
@10194 = ~The creatures of this place are all very unique in their nature. The owner of this place must be powerful indeed.~
@10195 = ~Do you feel the dark magic permeating everything, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? The entrance to Sendai's Enclave is not far.~
@10196 = ~I have seen many drow enclaves in my past, but this one appears to be especially well defended.~
@10197 = ~Behind every corner may await an ambushing party of drow and each chamber is likely filled with hordes of slaves, arachnids or magical beasts of all kinds.~
@10198 = ~You do not need to bother to conceal your presence. The drow will most surely know already where you are.~
@10199 = ~Drow are always paranoid of intruders of any kind and have likely spent a lot of resources into surveillance measures within the cave system.~
@10200 = ~I am aware that you are eager to catch up with your tormentor. However, you should take your time and plan ahead. The enemy surely expects you to follow their trail.~
@10201 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, do not worry too much about the fate of your childhood friend. You are already doing your best to reach her.~
@10202 = ~I suggest that you be wary of your current allies, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. There is no doubt in my mind that their interest in your plight is purely out of self interest.~
@10203 = ~The nature of your tasks given to you by your current allies has piqued my curiosity.~
@10204 = ~They do not seem to be aimed at gaining profit or power. I am wondering about their true intentions and your part in it.~
@10205 = ~You are playing with fire by working for Bodhi's vampire guild. Do not lower your guard even for a moment while you are in their domain, as treachery is part of their nature.~
@10206 = ~I share the loss of your soul, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, as I am in a similar predicament. However, not all hope is lost. You are alive and what has been done can almost always be undone.~
@10207 = ~Your soul may be gone, but it is not yet lost. Being alive means that you still share a connection with it. Let it guide you and you will surely reach your goal.~
@10208 = ~How are you doing, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? I can feel you are getting weaker with every step you take.~
@10209 = ~You are right. I can already feel the effects of my missing soul.~
@10210 = ~Don't worry, I can manage a nuisance such as this.~
@10211 = ~You can count on me, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I will support you in your search for your soul as best I can.~
@10212 = ~You can count on me, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I will support you in your search for your soul as best I can and I am sure your companions will too.~
@10213 = ~So you want to play the hero? Very well, I am confident that you will survive your current condition.~
@10214 = ~I am amazed how easily this Irenicus was able to take over ancient Suldanessellar. I doubt he would have done it as quickly without intimate knowledge about the town and their people.~
@10215 = ~Elves have always been very secretive about their objectives in the past. Judging from Elhan's responses I am convinced nothing has changed in that regard.~
@10216 = ~This Irenicus seems to leave a trail of devastation in his wake wherever he goes. I fear for the well-being of elven nature itself if he is not to be stopped soon.~
@10217 = ~I am still pondering over Melissan's interest in you and all the other Bhaalspawns. She must be an intelligent and powerful woman to know how to deal with their erratic behavior.~
@10218 = ~Yet she brought Gromnir Il-Khan and his men to Saradush knowing full well what they are capable of doing. She still remains a mystery to me.~
@10219 = ~Melissan claims to be a benefactor of the Bhaalspawns, yet she did nothing to prevent the destruction of Saradush and the Bhaalspawns within. It would have been well within her powers to prevent the disaster.~
@10220 = ~I am beginning to wonder about any ulterior motives behind her solicitous demeanor.~
@10221 = ~Do you suspect she might be a Bhaalspawn too?~
@10222 = ~Could you be more precise about your suspicions?~
@10223 = ~I think you are overanalyzing the situation. The ferocity of the attacks have caught her off guard as much as everyone else.~
@10224 = ~Possibly. At the very least, it would explain her unusual decision to collect all minor Bhaalspawns within the walls of Saradush.~
@10225 = ~Not at the moment, she is still a mystery to me.~
@10226 = ~I hope you are right, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@10227 = ~If the visions we have seen can be believed, then Melissan is no Bhaalspawn at all. That makes her meddlings into the Bhaalspawn affairs even more suspicious.~
@10228 = ~Maybe this Balthazar can give us a satisfactory answer in this matter.~
@10229 = ~Yaga-Shura's supposed invincibility is surely no result of Bhaal's powers. It is much more likely that sorcerous forces are behind it.~
@10230 = ~Even without his Bhaalspawn powers a fire giant like Yaga-Shura will be a formidable foe.~
@10231 = ~Abazigal is supposed to be related to the dragon kind. If that is true then you have to watch out for his Bhaalspawn powers and his dragon kind abilities as well.~
@10232 = ~Although Sendai is a drow, her special origins have surely made her an outcast, as drow see all others, even the non-purebred drow, as inferior.~
@10233 = ~You will likely have to deal with more than the usual drow forces if you want to deal with her.~
@10234 = ~This Balthazar appears to be a trained monk. Maybe there will be a chance to reason with him if his mental discipline is able to keep Bhaal's chaotic nature in check.~
@10235 = ~Monks have trained their mind and body to surpass human limits. This Balthazar may be even more powerful than Abazigal and Sendai together.~
@10236 = ~For a moment I felt myself detached from time and space, shortly after Bhaal's essence left Yaga-Shura's body.~
@10237 = ~It was a very unique experience. Do you have an explanation for it?~
@10238 = ~The Solar summoned me to teach me something about myself. It was a very strange experience, almost like a dream.~
@10239 = ~I had a dream-like experience, but I can't make head nor tail of it.~
@10240 = ~No, nothing special happened. You've probably imagined things.~
@10241 = ~So your lessons have already begun. You should take some time and reflect about what has happened, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@10242 = ~I am sure it was more than a dream. You should take some time and reflect about what has happened, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@10243 = ~Well, if you say so?~
@10244 = ~Your recent encounter with the Solar has revealed some truly disturbing news. If her revelations can be believed, then we have all been deceived by Melissan's disguise.~
@10245 = ~Even I could not detect any falsehood in her being despite her suspicious behavior in Saradush.~
@10246 = ~Of course, be my guest.~
@10247 = ~You can not tell from the outside, but the interior of my lamp is a miniature version of my home, the Elemental Plane of Air, without any form of exit. Although you can call me forth, I am always bound to that place, unable to break through the dimensional barrier completely.~
@10248 = ~You can not tell from the outside, but the interior of my lamp is a miniature version of my home, the Elemental Plane of Air.~
@10249 = ~My equipment and other items in my possession are also influenced by the lamp's enchantment. That is why even large objects can easily enter or leave the lamp.~
@10250 = ~So you have a lot of space in there, haven't you?~
@10251 = ~Yes, I have. Why do you ask, my <PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@10252 = ~Can I put some of my gear into your care?~
@10253 = ~That is no problem at all. Please keep in mind though that I am unable to help you while I am inside my lamp.~
@10254 = ~I would also strongly advise you against putting the djinni lamp into my care. Without it in your possession you will not be able to call me forth anymore.~
@10255 = ~Of course, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I am sure you have many questions about my people or myself.~
@10256 = ~First and foremost however, I should tell you something about that curious artifact you have in your possession.~
@10257 = ~Sure, why not?~
@10258 = ~As you can see, I am bound to a magical lamp. It is my home, my prison and my sanctuary.~
@10259 = ~Whenever I am badly hurt, I will retreat there and recover from my wounds. It will not take too long, I can assure you.~
@10260 = ~If I am in good health, you can call me forth by removing the plug from my lamp. I will also come from or go into the lamp whenever you ask me. Do not be shy to talk to me even while I am in there, I can hear you quite well.~
@10261 = ~I'd like to know more about you.~
@10262 = ~Thanks for your time, that is all I wanted to know.~
@10263 = ~Of course! What do you want to know, my <PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@10264 = ~Can you tell me about your people?~
@10265 = ~On second thought, I don't have the time for this.~
@10266 = ~Do you want to know more?~
@10267 = ~Can you tell me more about your people?~
@10268 = ~Can you tell me more about your abilities?~
@10269 = ~I can tell you much about our origins, our history and our culture. What do you know about my people, my <PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@10270 = ~I have considerable knowledge about your kind. The djinn are genies from the Elemental Plane of Air. They founded the Calim Empire ages ago and battled against an army of efreets, resulting in the creation of the Calim Desert.~
@10271 = ~I have heard of them. The djinni is a genie from the Elemental Plane of Air and one of their more commonly known powers is to grant wishes to mortals, am I right?~
@10272 = ~I have heard of them. Aren't they the kind of genies that grant wishes?~
@10273 = ~Truthfully, I don't know much about them.~
@10274 = ~I thought so. You do not strike me as the intellectual kind of <PRO_RACE>.~
@10275 = ~Really? You do not strike me as a <PRO_RACE> who neglected <PRO_HISHER> studies.~
@10276 = ~It saddens me that our kind is only known for its rather unimportant power to grant wishes. You are right, however.~
@10277 = ~You are right, our people hail from the Elemental Plane of Air. In fact, many of our kind are still living there.~
@10278 = ~I am impressed by your knowledge about us, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. You are right, a great number of our people travelled to the prime material plane millennia ago and settled in the region known as Calimshan in this day and age.~
@10279 = ~We are the djinn, genies of the Elemental Plane of Air. Eons ago, long before the dawn of the mortal races, our kind aided the primordials in their ancient battle with the gods over control of Faerûn. Most of the primordials had been destroyed or banished from Toril in the course of the war and many of my kind were imprisoned in common objects and scattered all over the plane.~
@10280 = ~Many ages ago a large group of djinn, led by our great leader Calim, travelled to Faerûn and founded the Calim Empire. This event has been recorded in your history books as "The Great Arrival". In a short time we had built large cities and proceeded to expand our domain to the south and west of the Marching Mountains.~
@10281 = ~Unfortunately, our progress had suffered a setback when we were attacked by a flight of dragons. As a result, our leader Calim led a campaign against the dragons of the Marching Mountains and returned victorious a couple of decades later.~
@10282 = ~(Eagerly listen to his story...)~
@10283 = ~(yawn) Oh, I'm sorry...please go on.~
@10284 = ~It sounds like you witnessed those events first-hand?~
@10285 = ~Very interesting, but let's talk about something else.~
@10286 = ~I see you have paid attention. You are right, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I was a soldier in the service of a lesser caliph at that time. The whole court followed Calim to Faerûn.~
@10287 = ~Our empire, reigned by the noble Calim, flourished for millennia. Only minor skirmishes with the neighboring races and the haughty marids threatened our rule at times.~
@10288 = ~However, a millennia or two later a series of events led to our downfall. Our enemies the efreets, led by their leader Memnon, moved against us. The following war lasted centuries and destroyed much of our empire.~
@10289 = ~Eventually, a group of elven high mages intervened and managed to capture both Calim and Memnon, along with a great number of djinn and efreet. They disembodied our leaders and bound their essences to the sky and earth which created a region now called the Calim Desert.~
@10290 = ~Our people along with the half-breeds and genasi were chased away or imprisoned into magical artifacts. I was fortunate to escape relatively unscathed.~
@10291 = ~(Continue intently listening to his story...)~
@10292 = ~Did you also take part in this terrible war, Afaaq?~
@10293 = ~(snore) ...uh, what? Ah yes, I'm still listening.~
@10294 = ~Yes, I did. I was a soldier at that time.~
@10295 = ~The battlefield was nothing you would see in this day and age. The air was charged with powerful magics to the point that it pierced the fabric of reality itself. You must understand that it happened long before the fall of Netheril. Even your most powerful spells would not compare in the least to the magics wielded in those battles.~
@10296 = ~The toll of life on both sides was unimaginable. Beings such as us genies are merely cast back into the void only to re-emerge some time later in our respective plane of origin. The majority of combatants were mortal however, and even a great many immortal beings had been enslaved or imprisoned into magical artifacts in the course of the war.~
@10297 = ~Although I survived the war relatively unscathed, it changed the very core of my existence forever...~
@10298 = ~Yes, but I do not want to talk about it.~
@10299 = ~In the following centuries, many of our people returned to our home or founded their own empires somewhere on or above Faerûn, hidden from the curious eyes of mortals.~
@10300 = ~Others are still bound to artifacts waiting to be released one day. A great many of them have been discovered and misused by you mortals, hence it is commonly known that we are able to grant wishes to your kind.~
@10301 = ~A fascinating story. Do you mind telling me more about your culture, Afaaq?~
@10302 = ~(yawn) Your long-winded and weary talk reminds me of the classes I had to attend in Candlekeep.~
@10303 = ~(snore) zzz... (yawn) ...oh, you are finished already?~
@10304 = ~Hmm, what can I tell you... Do you know something about our social structures?~
@10305 = ~I know that your people are ruled by the Grand Caliph. There are also lesser caliphs, viziers and other noble djinns who are subject to the Grand Caliph's rule.~
@10306 = ~I've heard that your people live in grand palaces high above the clouds.~
@10307 = ~No, nothing at all.~
@10308 = ~I can imagine that it is no common knowledge to you mortals. We rarely allow outsiders into our homes.~
@10309 = ~Are you sure? I thought you might have heard at least bits and pieces about us.~
@10310 = ~That is not too far from the truth, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@10311 = ~I am amazed how much you know about our people, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@10312 = ~Our society centers around the Grand Caliph Husam al-Balil ben Nafhat al-Yugayyim, also known as the Master of the Clouds, the Son of the Breezes and by many other titles to other races.~
@10313 = ~We have been ruled by him since the beginnings of time. You mortals most likely do not know much about him, as he lives in the Court of Ice and Steel within the Elemental Plane of Air.~
@10314 = ~He is served by various nobles and officials, including lesser caliphs, viziers, beys, emirs, sheiks, sherrifs, and maliks. Most of the djinns in existence were at one time or another in the service of a caliph or other noble.~
@10315 = ~The word of the Grand Caliph is law. Disobeying him always means death, but a djinni may risk punishment even for breaking the laws of the lesser nobles.~
@10316 = ~That is why many djinn left their home and visited Faerûn or other places outside the jurisdiction of the Grand Caliph.~
@10317 = ~Did you leave your home for the same reason?~
@10318 = ~An interesting insight into your culture, but let's talk about something else.~
@10319 = ~You are very perceptive, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Our great leader Calim and all who followed him shared a common ideal. Leaving behind our restrictive government was surely part of it.~
@10320 = ~If I bore you with my talk you should let me know, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@10321 = ~I have! Didn't you notice?~
@10322 = ~Not at all, but I didn't sleep much last night. May we continue the lessons at a later time?~
@10323 = ~Not really, it was quite refreshing. Now that I've rested, let's return to our task.~
@10324 = ~I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother you with my snoring.~
@10325 = ~(Hmpf) If you are through with your fun, we may continue our journey.~
@10326 = ~Yes, that is probably for the best.~
@10327 = ~As you wish. Firstly, I will present you a short summary of my skills...~
@10328 = ~As you can see, I am skilled in both using swords and magic. My current predicament limits my abilities, however. Being a djinni grants me a couple of additional traits as well.~
@10329 = ~I can see in the dark and tolerate magical or electrical energies to a certain degree.~
@10330 = ~Furthermore, my link to the lamp allows me to slowly recover from my wounds. However, I would be grateful if you could spare a healing potion or two in times of need. As I have told you before, I will recover much faster while I am inside the lamp.~
@10331 = ~The traditional weapon of choice for most djinns is the scimitar. My own blade is magically attuned to my soul, therefore I can control how it will affect my targets. Because of my current predicament, I can not show you its true powers, however.~
@10332 = ~Can you tell me again how you can help me in my adventures?~
@10333 = ~What can you tell me about your powers?~
@10334 = ~Let's talk about something else.~
@10335 = ~Thanks to your help, I can finally display my full potential in both using swords and magic. Being a djinni grants me a couple of additional traits as well.~
@10336 = ~I can see in the dark and am highly impervious to magical and electrical energies.~
@10337 = ~Furthermore, I have the ability to slowly recover from my wounds. However, I would be grateful if you could spare a healing potion or two in times of need. As I have told you before, I will recover much faster while I am inside the lamp.~
@10338 = ~The traditional weapon of choice for most djinns is the scimitar. My own blade is magically attuned to my soul, therefore I can control how it will affect my targets. Being in full control of my soul, my scimitar can show its true powers once again. An opponent hit by the weapon has to suffer electrical damage in addition to the scimitar's slashing damage, and has a small chance to be stunned for a short time.~
@10339 = ~Can you tell me about your powers?~
@10340 = ~I have gained a number of unique abilities in my time on and beyond the prime material plane. What power do you want me to talk about?~
@10341 = ~Can you tell me more about your power to grant wishes?~
@10342 = ~Can you tell me more about your innate power to turn invisible?~
@10346 = ~Can you tell me more about your power to control Air Elementals?~
@10347 = ~Granting wishes is probably the best known power of the djinni kind. My current predicament, however, limits it considerably.~
@10348 = ~I am able to grant you wishes which allow you to alter reality in a limited manner. The right wording is of utmost importance, however. An unwise person will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.~
@10349 = ~Can you tell me more about your whirlwind power?~
@10350 = ~Can you tell me more about your power to haste yourself?~
@10351 = ~Can you tell me more about your Air Shield power?~
@10352 = ~Granting wishes is probably the best known power of the djinni kind. You can choose how strongly your wish can alter reality.~
@10353 = ~A limited wish will alter reality centered around yourself. A powerful wish, however, can lead to global disaster, if not worded correctly. I will trust in your sense of responsibility when you ask for a wish.~
@10354 = ~Being born from the chaotic forces of air, I am blessed with the power to turn invisible at will.~
@10355 = ~The effect will stay active for several hours. However, it can be dispelled by magical means or I may reveal myself when I interact with the world around me.~
@10356 = ~I am able to raise a small whirlwind in a controlled manner which is centered around myself. Being a creature of air, I have full control over it, naturally. Therefore I can choose how it affects my surrounding.~
@10357 = ~As a result, I will concentrate its power only on creatures with hostile intent. The wind can blow around smaller chunks of debris damaging or even blinding nearby creatures.~
@10358 = ~Being in full control of myself, I have the power to raise whirlwinds which can move around on their own. Each whirlwind can travel freely across the area, damaging or even blinding nearby enemies in their way.~
@10359 = ~Since whirlwinds are extensions of myself, I can control them even if they move out of my sight.~
@10360 = ~The ability to increase my movement has been granted by the very air itself. It will increase almost all aspects of movement caused by my physical body.~
@10361 = ~Therefore I can move faster as well as increase my attack speed. The effect will last for about an hour.~
@10362 = ~I have witnessed that your kind has learned how to cast elemental shields of fire.~
@10363 = ~My people have learned to raise magical shields of air around them. They provide both protection and a means to harm attackers.~
@10364 = ~A shield of air makes me immune to all kinds of electrical damage and partially shields me from missiles, and magical and physical damage.~
@10365 = ~Additionally, each time I am physically attacked, the shield attempts to retaliate against the attacker within a certain radius.~
@10366 = ~Our close link to the elemental forces of air has given us the power to exercise limited control over beings born out of or having close links to it.~
@10367 = ~Air Elementals are self-aware entities, born out of the forces of the Elemental Plane of Air. Invisible Stalkers are also closely related to the Elemental Plane of Air. I have the power to bring all of them under my control for a short time.~
@10368 = ~Opposing aerial creatures are usually protected against that kind of attack by their summoners. As a result, I will not always be successful in my attempts.~
@10369 = ~It was a pleasure talking to you.~
@10370 = ~Suit yourself!~
@10371 = ~That is not possible at the moment. I still need some time to recover from my injuries.~
@10372 = ~I am unable to do that in this place. My magic is being sucked away.~
@10373 = ~The djinni begins to concentrate but nothing happens. Maybe he doesn't sense his magical lamp which is notably absent from your backpack.~
@10374 = ~The djinni begins to concentrate and after a few moments he vanishes into thin air. Only a faint glow inside his lamp remains.~
@10375 = ~Alright, I will stay out of the action.~
@10376 = ~Sure, I will enter the heat of battle on my own.~
@10377 = ~Yes, I could use an antidote.~
@10378 = ~Here, take this Antidote.~
@10379 = ~Here, take this Elixir of Health.~
@10380 = ~I don't have a spare antidote, sorry.~
@10381 = ~Thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@10382 = ~Thank you very much, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@10383 = ~Yes, if you have one to spare?~
@10384 = ~This Potion of Healing should heal your injuries.~
@10385 = ~This Potion of Extra Healing should heal your injuries.~
@10386 = ~This Potion of Superior Healing should heal your injuries.~
@10387 = ~I don't have a spare healing potion, sorry.~
@10388 = ~Thank you. I accept your offer.~
@10389 = ~Thank you very much. I accept your offer.~
@10390 = ~Thank you. I accept your generous offer.~
@10391 = ~(sigh) Then I have to manage without it.~
@10392 = ~Yes, if you have some to spare?~
@10393 = ~I can give you Potions of Healing.~
@10394 = ~I can give you Potions of Extra Healing.~
@10395 = ~I can give you Potions of Superior Healing.~
@10396 = ~I can give you Antidote potions.~
@10397 = ~I can give you Elixirs of Health.~
@10398 = ~Then I have to manage with the remaining potions in my possession.~
@10399 = ~Then I have to manage without it.~
@10400 = ~How many potions can you give me?~
@10401 = ~I can give you one Potion of Healing.~
@10402 = ~I can give you two Potions of Healing.~
@10403 = ~I can give you three Potions of Healing.~
@10404 = ~I can give you four Potions of Healing.~
@10405 = ~I can give you five Potions of Healing.~
@10406 = ~Thank you my <PRO_LADYLORD>, but I have already a good number of healing potions in my possession.~
@10407 = ~I can give you one Potion of Extra Healing.~
@10408 = ~I can give you two Potions of Extra Healing.~
@10409 = ~I can give you three Potions of Extra Healing.~
@10410 = ~I can give you four Potions of Extra Healing.~
@10411 = ~I can give you five Potions of Extra Healing.~
@10412 = ~Thank you my <PRO_LADYLORD>, but I have already a good number of extra healing potions in my possession.~
@10413 = ~I can give you one Potion of Superior Healing.~
@10414 = ~I can give you two Potions of Superior Healing.~
@10415 = ~I can give you three Potions of Superior Healing.~
@10416 = ~I can give you four Potions of Superior Healing.~
@10417 = ~I can give you five Potions of Superior Healing.~
@10418 = ~Thank you my <PRO_LADYLORD>, but I have already a good number of superior healing potions in my possession.~
@10419 = ~I can give you one Antidote potion.~
@10420 = ~I can give you two Antidote potions.~
@10421 = ~I can give you three Antidote potions.~
@10422 = ~I can give you four Antidote potions.~
@10423 = ~I can give you five Antidote potions.~
@10424 = ~I don't have a spare antidote potion, sorry.~
@10425 = ~Thank you my <PRO_LADYLORD>, but I have already a good number of antidote potions in my possession.~
@10426 = ~I can give you one Elixir of Health.~
@10427 = ~I can give you two Elixirs of Health.~
@10428 = ~I can give you three Elixirs of Health.~
@10429 = ~I can give you four Elixirs of Health.~
@10430 = ~I can give you five Elixirs of Health.~
@10431 = ~Thank you my <PRO_LADYLORD>, but I have already a good number of elixirs in my possession.~
@10432 = ~See you later.~
@10433 = ~Until next time.~
@10434 = ~I am sorry, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. But you have to wait a while longer before I am able to grant you a wish.~
@10435 = ~I will grant you a limited wish. You may ask for a wish I can repeat, or you may ask for a wish that will happen once only. Decide.~
@10436 = ~Very well then.~
@10437 = ~Are you interested in a limited or a more powerful Wish?~
@10438 = ~I'd like to choose a Limited Wish.~
@10439 = ~I'd like to choose a Wish.~
@10440 = ~I will grant you a wish. But choose wisely, for I will carry out your wishes literally.~
@10441 = ~You describe to the djinni your thoughts as accurately as possible.~
@10442 = ~Afaaq listens to you closely and writes down everything you tell him.~
@10443 = ~After a while his list is completed and he presents to you a summary of your ideas.~
@10444 = ~Very well, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I can interpret the items listed here in the following ways. Choose carefully which you would prefer.~
@10445 = ~Globe of Blades on the caster.~
@10446 = ~Party gains 10,000 gp.~
@10447 = ~I wish to lose the game.~
@10448 = ~I wish to win the game.~
@10449 = ~I don't want to choose a wish at this time.~
@10450 = ~Very well. Maybe a Potion of Insight might help.~
@10451 = ~The djinni smiles to himself before he turns to you. "Are you sure you want to end your journey so soon?"~
@10452 = ~Yes, absolutely. Do it!~
@10453 = ~I was just kidding.~
@10454 = ~As you wish. It was nice knowing you.~
@10455 = ~The djinni smiles to himself before he turns to you. "Are you sure you want to finish your adventure so easily?"~
@10456 = ~As you wish.~
@10457 = ~The djinni lays his eyes on you and concentrates for a moment. After a few moments everything becomes blurry around you...~
@10458 = ~That is difficult to explain. Think of it as a miniature pocket plane, similar to your own. But it is made to look and feel like a part of the Elemental Plane of Air.~
@10459 = ~Hmm, why do you not take a look for yourself, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? I can link you to a projected image of yourself inside the lamp. That is the only way for you to enter the lamp safely.~
@10460 = ~No, it's too dangerous.~
@10461 = ~Okay, here we go...~
@10462 = ~Here we go. Brace yourself!~
@10463 = ~There is very little risk involved. You can ask me whenever you are ready to go.~
@10464 = ~???~
@10465 = ~No, it does not work. The special nature of your pocket plane prevents me from using some of my own powers.~
@10466 = ~Very well, I will cut your link to the projected image. This will take only a moment...~
@10467 = ~I will attempt to do so. Please wait a moment.~
@10468 = ~...~
@10469 = ~It is done. If you still notice some odd behavior, you should tell my creator.~
@10470 = ~The djinni closes his eyes and concentrates for a few moments...~
@10471 = ~What do you want to know about me?~
@10472 = ~Can you tell me about your skills?~
@10473 = ~I am loath to tell outsiders of our culture or history. Maybe later when we know each other better.~
@10474 = ~Soon you will have your quest, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@10475 = ~Please take care of yourself in battle.~
@10476 = ~Sure, I will take care of myself if necessary.~
@10477 = ~Since you have greatly assisted my friends to avert the threat against their stronghold, I will help you formulate wishes in your favor.~
@10478 = ~Can you tell me more about how you are able to transfer your knowledge to other people?~
@10479 = ~In my long life I have visited many places, met countless beings and came across a great number of enchanted artifacts. Furthermore, our kind had always been gifted with the powers of divination and illusion.~
@10480 = ~Theses powers allow me to grant a person access to my accumulated knowledge for a short period of time to determine the true nature of powerful artifacts.~
@10481 = ~Do you want to drink a potion?~
@10482 = ~I don't have any potions to spare, sorry.~
@10483 = ~How about a Potion of Fire Resistance?~
@10484 = ~How about a Potion of Heroism?~
@10485 = ~How about a Potion of Invulnerability?~
@10486 = ~How about some Oil of Speed?~
@10487 = ~How about a Potion of Absorption?~
@10488 = ~How about a Potion of Clarity?~
@10489 = ~How about a Potion of Cold Resistance?~
@10490 = ~How about a Potion of Defense?~
@10491 = ~How about a Potion of Insulation?~
@10492 = ~How about a Potion of Magic Blocking?~
@10493 = ~How about a Potion of Magic Protection?~
@10494 = ~How about a Potion of Magic Shielding?~
@10495 = ~How about a Potion of Power?~
@10496 = ~How about a Potion of Freedom?~
@10497 = ~How about a Potion of Stone Form?~
@10498 = ~How about a Brine Potion, brewed from a pool of illithid tadpoles?~
@10499 = ~Please keep yourself constantly hasted.~
@10500 = ~Please don't keep yourself constantly hasted.~
@10501 = ~Sure, I will try to keep myself constantly hasted.~
@10502 = ~Alright, I will stop trying to keep myself constantly hasted.~
@10503 = ~A repeatable wish.~

@11131 = ~Hmm, you remind me of my last visit to Calimport. Our host served us wonderfully exotic dishes seemingly out of thin air. He commanded someone like you, if I remember correctly.~
@11132 = ~(sigh) You are probably right about that. It saddens me that a great number of my kind has been degraded to serve self-centered mortal fools for their petty amusements.~
@11133 = ~Ah, I was right then.  You wouldn't be interested in serving me sometime? I am a man of great influence and wealth.~

@11144 = ~I'm afraid not, little one. You see, that is a very special lamp, because a djinni is living inside.~
@11145 = ~That isn't possible, because... this is a cursed lamp, and it will swallow little girls whole if they open the stopper.~
@11146 = ~Never! And now get lost, girl!~

@11148 = ~Noo, I don't want to be swallowed!  Especially not by shiny cursed lamps.~

@11152 = ~Yay!  You are a nice man too.~

@11181 = ~Yes, indeed I am, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I must commend you for grasping the obvious so quickly.~
@11182 = ~My enslavement to the lamp was caused by powerful rakshasa sorcery. Usually I am capable of fending off their attacks easily, but adverse circumstances have led to my current plight.~
@11183 = ~I will accompany you as long as you have my lamp in your possession. Truth be told, there is no other way while I am trapped in its enchantments.~
@11184 = ~If you need my help, you can talk to me whenever you want.~
@11185 = ~I thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. You have rescued me again from those despicable rakshasa, and for that I am grateful. I doubt they will hunt me down anymore as you have killed the one who managed to bind me to the lamp.~
@11186 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, I can feel it!  Yes, I am almost certain of it.~
@11187 = ~I can feel my stolen spiritual essence somewhere nearby. Does this also mean I am to face that person again?~
@11188 = ~Are you talking about the drow who enslaved you once long ago?~
@11189 = ~Afaaq, what are you talking about?~
@11190 = ~We don't have time to search for the ghosts of your past. My first priority is to find Irenicus.~
@11191 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, I can feel it!~
@11192 = ~I can feel my stolen spiritual essence somewhere nearby. The drow party mentioned by those duergars are most certainly in possession of it.~
@11193 = ~Does this mean I am to face that person again?~
@11194 = ~Yes, I am. He took a vital part of my spiritual essence and sealed it away. Even though I have escaped his grasp, my essence is still in his possession.~
@11195 = ~I implore you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, to help me get my spiritual essence back. I doubt that I will get a chance like this a second time.~
@11196 = ~Of course, I will help you find your lost soul. I know that feeling of loss too well myself.~
@11197 = ~I'll keep my eyes open, but I can't promise anything.~
@11198 = ~I will think about it if the opportunity actually arises. My first priority is to find Irenicus after all.~
@11199 = ~As I have mentioned before, my binding to the lamp had been made possible only because of adverse circumstances. Those circumstances were caused by a drow party that crossed my path ages ago.~
@11200 = ~I do not want to go into the details, but the drow have taken a major part of my spiritual essence and sealed it away. The loss of my essence made it even impossible for me to return to my home plane.~
@11201 = ~Of course, I will help you find your lost soul. I know that feeling of loss all too well myself.~
@11202 = ~I do understand your impatience, but I implore you not to turn your back on me when the opportunity arises.~
@11203 = ~You are right, of course. I will help you find your lost essence.~
@11204 = ~I will think about it if the opportunity actually arises.~
@11205 = ~I am grateful for your assistance, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Without your help I would surely be helpless before my former master.~
@11206 = ~Fair enough. I trust that you will decide wisely in the end.~
@11207 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, I urge you to investigate the drow encampment that the duergar merchants have mentioned. You do not know how long your stay in the Underdark may last.~
@11208 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, I implore you to investigate whether I am right about my spiritual essence being nearby. I have felt it strongest near the duergar merchants.~
@11209 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, I am truly impressed by your steadfast dedication to support the downtrodden and fight against evil. You are an honorable <PRO_MANWOMAN> and I am proud to fight at your side.~
@11210 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, I am sensing a powerful alien presence nearby. It is emanating from somewhere behind that door.~
@11211 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, I am sensing a powerful alien presence nearby. It is emanating from somewhere down below this room.~
@11212 = ~The presence is much stronger now. I can feel it coming from somewhere down below this room.~
@11213 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, be careful! I can sense an ancient and powerful presence in this room.~
@11214 = ~The presence is very near. It must be ancient and very powerful.~
@11215 = ~Something does not feel right. I urge you to be very careful, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@11216 = ~Now that the slavers and their base have been destroyed, you have made this part of the town a little safer...at least for a while. It is now for the authorities and the citizens themselves to prevent their return.~
@11217 = ~You have taken a significant risk rescuing the actors by following them into unknown territory. You could have easily shared their fate in the end.~
@11218 = ~Your actions speak well of you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, and I am honored to share your company.~
@11219 = ~That is a terrible fate, to be tormented endlessly by the drow without hope of deliverance. If we were not on a mission of secrecy, I would gladly free the djinni from his bonds.~
@11220 = ~I thank you for risking your disguise and even your life to release the djinni from his bonds, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Do not worry though, by destroying his physical shell he was able to return home without taking permanent damage.~
@11221 = ~I am glad that we could free the slaves from the Illithids. With luck they will reach the surface eventually.~
@11222 = ~What did you find on the body of the drow, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? I am sensing a familiar presence in your possession.~
@11223 = ~Yes, I am sure of it. You have found the collection of imprisoned souls Tathas Melarn has captured in his lifetime. Let me examine it more closely...~
@11224 = ~I have finally found a glimmer of hope that my imprisonment will come to an end. This crystal contains a major portion of my spiritual essence. Unfortunately it is sealed away and I have not the power to break it. I implore you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, please keep it safe from any harm until I find a way to access its contents.~
@11225 = ~The soulcage is in our possession and I can finally see a glimmer of hope that my imprisonment will come to an end.~
@11226 = ~Unfortunately the seal which protects it is strong and I have not the power to break it. I implore you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, please keep it safe from any harm until I find a way to access its contents.~
@11227 = ~Welcome to my home, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@11228 = ~After you broke the enchantments which bound me to the lamp, I have tried to make this pocket plane more homely by creating this small platform of solid matter.~
@11229 = ~Please make yourself at home, but do not keep your friends waiting for too long. And if you want to leave again, just talk to me.~
@11230 = ~Please make yourself at home as long as you want. And if you want to leave again, just talk to me.~
@11231 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, I strongly advise you to hide my presence before you enter the lower caves. Whatever has made its home down there will surely react with hostility to any djinn intrusion.~
@11232 = ~Good point. I think you should take a rest for a while.~
@11233 = ~Maybe you could tag along if you turn invisible.~
@11234 = ~Thanks for the warning, but I'll take my chances.~
@11235 = ~That is a sensible precaution.~
@11236 = ~You are playing with fire, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! The enemy might have the ability to sense me nonetheless. It is worth a try though.~
@11237 = ~That is up to you.~
@11238 = ~I despise you, <CHARNAME>, for what you have done to Sharif Karim and his subordinates. Your actions are many times worse than the humiliations I have suffered in the past.~
@11239 = ~I will let you feel what it means to provoke the wrath of a djinni. Prepare yourself!~
@11240 = ~Please let me speak to <CHARNAME>.~
@11241 = ~My body... my mind... I am whole again. And I have to thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, for it.~
@11242 = ~As you have helped me, I pledge my service and my eternal friendship to you as long as you desire.~
@11243 = ~You have helped me regain my powers, so I will help you in turn to reclaim your soul.~
@11244 = ~But I will not stay much longer.~
@11245 = ~I need to speak with <CHARNAME>.~
@11246 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, I have something important to discuss with you.~
@11247 = ~You have your soul back and I have fulfilled my promise to you. It is now your turn to keep your promise. Please release me from your service.~
@11248 = ~You are right, Afaaq. You are free and I wish you well on your journey home.~
@11249 = ~You are a very important member of our party. Won't you reconsider your decision to leave?~
@11250 = ~That is not possible, because I dumped your lamp long ago.~
@11251 = ~You are too useful to let you go. I won't allow it.~
@11252 = ~I thank you wholeheartedly. You have shown great wisdom in your decision and I will not forget it.~
@11253 = ~I wish you well and may your future shine brightly, <CHARNAME>.~
@11254 = ~But before I go, you should retrieve all items that you have left me for safekeeping. Who knows when we will meet each other again?~
@11255 = ~Have you picked up everything you need?~
@11256 = ~I'm not sure. Please let me take a look again.~
@11257 = ~Yes, I have. Thank you again for all your help. Farewell!~
@11258 = ~I have stayed for too long on the prime material plane. As much as I appreciate your request, I long to see my home again.~
@11259 = ~Then I release you from my service. You are free and I wish you well on your journey home.~
@11260 = ~I have to keep you in my party. You are too useful to let you go.~
@11261 = ~This is the most impudent insult I have heard for ages. You have deliberately cut off my means to be free.~
@11262 = ~If you deny my wish to release me, I have to force you to keep your promise. Prepare yourself!~
@11263 = ~The undead usually do not bother the living unless there is a very good reason.~
@11264 = ~Maybe Afaaq can help you with a wish...~
@11265 = ~I might indeed grant <CHARNAME> the wish to remove your curse, if <PRO_HESHE> is willing.~
@11266 = ~I wish Raissa's curse of the skin dancer to be removed.~
@11267 = ~Granted. Raissa's curse will been removed.~
@11268 = ~After you restored my sealed powers, I have tried to make this pocket plane more homely by creating this small platform of solid matter.~
@11269 = ~I appreciate your selfless act to release one of my kin from imprisonment, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. You could have just as well taken advantage of his current plight instead.~
@11270 = ~I wish Edwin to be released from his imprisonment.~
@11271 = ~Granted. Edwin will be released from his imprisonment.~


// *** Banters with <PC> (index 12000...12999) ***
// interjections and specific talks
@12000 = ~It appears you are very single-minded about following the trail of this Irenicus. Do you mind telling me why you are doing it?~
@12001 = ~Irenicus took a very close friend of mine with him, and I intend to get her back to my side.~
@12002 = ~Both Irenicus and my childhood friend Imoen have been abducted by the Cowled Mages, and I won't leave them to their fates.~
@12003 = ~This is a personal matter. I don't want to talk about it.~
@12004 = ~I respect your decision, but I am now part of your life too. Will you not reconsider?~
@12005 = ~If you insist. Irenicus took a very close friend of mine with him, and I intend to get her back to my side.~
@12006 = ~Very well. Both Irenicus and my childhood friend Imoen have been abducted by the Cowled Mages, and I won't leave them to their fates.~
@12007 = ~No, this is something I have to solve by myself.~
@12008 = ~As you wish.~
@12009 = ~So you want to make sure that your friend does not come to harm?~
@12010 = ~Well, I don't really care that much for her. I merely want to make sure that Irenicus doesn't get a second chance to hurt us again.~
@12011 = ~You are right. I'm sure she would do the same if I were in a bind.~
@12012 = ~I see. Good luck on your quest, though. I hope you find both of them quickly.~
@12013 = ~I wish you success in your quest, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. A bond of friendship, as the one you two obviously share, is a great boon to have.~
@12014 = ~We do share bonds of trust and friendship with our siblings as well. But it is expressed in a different way than you mortals would imagine.~
@12015 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, you are finally reunited with your childhood friend Imoen.~
@12016 = ~Do you care to introduce her to me?~
@12017 = ~Sure, why not? This is my little sister and good friend Imoen. She went through a terrible ordeal and I'm glad that she is at my side again.~
@12018 = ~I don't have the time for this, at the moment.~
@12019 = ~Little sister is good. I'd rather see *you* as my little <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>, <CHARNAME>.~
@12020 = ~And you are our new travelling companion, Afaaq? You look like a cheerful fellow.~
@12021 = ~I am honored to make your acquaintance, Imoen.~
@12022 = ~You betcha! I'm sure we'll get on like a house on fire, hehe.~
@12023 = ~Ah, I am looking forward to your company, too.~
@12024 = ~That is a pity. I am sure Imoen is curious about the new companion at her side.~
@12025 = ~You betcha!  Be prepared for a barrage of questions, Afaaq.~
@12026 = ~Your victory over Firkraag reminds me of my part in the great battle against the dragons of the Marching Mountains.~
@12027 = ~You have battled against dragons?~
@12028 = ~I don't really have time to listen to one of your long-winded stories again.~
@12029 = ~Yes, I did long ago. At that time, dragons were much more numerous than today, and in the Marching Mountains it was doubly so.~
@12030 = ~I still remember the sheer size of the armies. Our side consisted mostly of djinn, genasi and some of the mortal races, while the dragons mobilized hordes of wyverns, drakes and dragons of all kinds.~
@12031 = ~Although both sides were very well prepared, the number of casualties was unbelievably high. It didn't really matter to us, as we were merely thrown back to our home plane, but the mortal races suffered considerable losses as well.~
@12032 = ~Fortunately those times are long since past, and today the surviving dragons live quite reclusively, hidden from most other life forms.~
@12033 = ~As you wish. Nevertheless, I am impressed with your skills in vanquishing a dragon. Even a dreaded red one at that.~
@12034 = ~So, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I see that you have become a lot stronger in the short time of my absence. What have you accomplished since your victory over Irenicus?~
@12035 = ~I had to fight for my life all the time, as one Bhaalspawn after another wanted me dead. What have you done in that time?~
@12036 = ~Oh, the usual. Cleaning out abandoned temples, defeating Bhaalspawns and the like. And you?~
@12037 = ~Oh, the usual. Cleaning out abandoned temples, defeating Bhaalspawns and demon princes. And you?~
@12038 = ~I was busy hunting down other Bhaalspawns. What about you?~
@12039 = ~I'd rather not talk about it. What did you do after you left my presence?~
@12040 = ~I had thought long and hard about what I wanted to do with my newfound freedom. I even considered returning into the service of my old employer Caliph Hasib.~
@12041 = ~But then it occurred to me that there are more poor souls waiting to be released from imprisonment and I began searching for them. I followed several vague hints and leads when I bumped into a former colleague of mine, Sharif Karim.~
@12042 = ~I decided to help him out, as he was in dire need of help at that moment. Shortly after you came around and saved the day, as usual. I am truly grateful for that.~
@12043 = ~And now you have joined my adventures again. Are you sure that is what you really want?~
@12044 = ~And that event has led to our reunion. Why have you decided to follow me again?~
@12045 = ~I have come to the conclusion that I can achieve much more by helping you out.~
@12046 = ~You have dealt with the efreet army in an impressive manner. By helping you in your quest, I have the opportunity to return a small measure of the gratitude Sharif Karim has expressed.~
// banters
@12200 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, I am sensing something unusual from you. A restless, malevolent aura.~
@12201 = ~Although I have witnessed your cruel character already, this kind of evil does not feel natural. It is almost as if there is a duality within your soul.~
@12202 = ~This isn't too far from the truth, Afaaq. I am harboring the divine essence of a dead god within me.~
@12203 = ~Hehe, maybe this is a side you don't know about me yet.~
@12204 = ~What are you talking about? This is my true self, you have already seen what I am capable of.~
@12205 = ~But it does not fit your character at all, as I can sense your benevolent nature as well. It is almost as if there is a duality within your soul.~
@12206 = ~Really? Maybe this is a side of me you haven't seen yet.~
@12207 = ~I don't know what you are talking about? I am me and nothing else.~
@12208 = ~If you say so?  However, my senses usually do not let me down.~
@12209 = ~I suspected something like this. Do you mind telling me more about it?~
@12210 = ~Why not? It hasn't been a real secret anyway for quite some time now. I am a child of the dead god Bhaal. He somehow foresaw his own death during the Time of Troubles and took precautions to make sure that his death wouldn't be permanent. I am one of his 'precautions'.~
@12211 = ~I see.  Your soul has been tainted by the divine essence of an evil god, and it has turned you into a pale reflection of its former self.~
@12212 = ~Watch your mouth, genie! Bhaal's power is under MY control and I will use it to become even more powerful.~
@12213 = ~You don't know anything about me! I will learn how to use Bhaal's power to my advantage.~
@12214 = ~Don't talk like that! You are MY servant now and have to act accordingly.~
@12215 = ~I don't care for your conclusions. How I'm living my life is my own affair.~
@12216 = ~I see.  And although your soul has been tainted by the divine essence of an evil god, you have retained enough willpower to resist its temptations. That is most impressive.~
@12217 = ~Thank you. But I couldn't have done it without the support of my friends and family.~
@12218 = ~It probably helped a lot that I grew up in a stable and sheltered environment.~
@12219 = ~That may be. However, my true challenges lie before me yet.~
@12220 = ~I don't really want to talk about it.~
@12221 = ~Are you not deceiving yourself? Bhaal's essence is not an alien force you can push aside or tap for its powers. It is part of you and you are part of 'it'.~
@12222 = ~I'll take the risks if it means becoming a power by myself.~
@12223 = ~It doesn't matter to me, as long as it serves its purpose.~
@12224 = ~As you wish. I thank you nonetheless that you have taken me into your confidence.~
@12225 = ~But even if you had some guidance in the past, it still takes a strong and steadfast character to come as far as you have without showing signs of corruption.~
@12226 = ~Wherever your path will take you, I am certain that you will prevail in the end.~
@12227 = ~Life is a continuous succession of challenges. You have come far and I can not see any signs of corruption darkening your soul yet.~
@12228 = ~You do not need to justify yourself, as it is your life in the end which is at stake. If you have no regrets about the path you have taken, then I have no right to interfere.~
@12229 = ~I have not really thanked you for my release from those rakshasa.~
@12230 = ~Don't mention it. I will always help a friend of mine in need.~
@12231 = ~I'm certain you will find a way to thank me properly.~
@12232 = ~I am honored by your words, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@12233 = ~Be assured that I will pay back my debt when the time comes.~
@12234 = ~My captors belonged to a cult that worshipped Ravanna, one of their god kings. I have rarely seen such fanaticism as in their high priest.~
@12235 = ~He was responsible for binding me to the lamp. Even though I had been in a weakened state at that time, the rakshasa was no match for me... Until he called forth the powers of Ravanna.~
@12236 = ~What happened then?~
@12237 = ~To tell the truth, I'd rather not hear the gruesome details of your defeat.~
@12238 = ~The summoned creature was a nightmare in appearance. His gaze alone would have instilled panic into the strongest of men.~
@12239 = ~My magic did not work against that beast and the damage caused by my physical attacks healed before I could seriously wound it.~
@12240 = ~His attacks were ferocious. I had to parry his physical attacks and evade his dark magic at the same time. But I was not fast enough in the end.~
@12241 = ~I can barely remember what hit me. It enshrouded me in a dark and cold aura of despair and my consciousness slipped away.~
@12242 = ~When I awakened, I was tightly held by the shackles of the lamp, only allowed to act as the rakshasa wished it.~
@12243 = ~I can understand you. Just thinking about it still pains my soul.~
@12244 = ~As you can see by my current state, I was no match afterwards.~
@12245 = ~Telling you this was not easy for me, but I am deeply indebted to you for my rescue.~
@12246 = ~With the death of their high priest, however, I do not expect any more attacks from the remaining members of their cult.~
@12247 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, you show exceptional skill and power in your dealings with obstacles thrown in your path. I haven't seen many mortals who have developed themselves so rapidly. It is most impressive and very difficult to accomplish without additional help.~
@12248 = ~If you must know, I had indeed additional help. I am harboring the divine essence of a dead god within me.~
@12249 = ~Do you know the human proverb 'Curiosity killed the cat', Afaaq?~
@12250 = ~Very well. I will not inquire further if you are not willing to take me into your confidence.~
@12251 = ~I have thought about what you told me about your heritage.~
@12252 = ~Since you mentioned that it is not a real secret anymore, am I right in thinking that you already had to deal with your special nature in the past?~
@12253 = ~I'm afraid so. Another Bhaalspawn by the name of Sarevok planned to ascend to godhood by throwing a whole region into chaos and terror. He killed my stepfather Gorion and attempted to murder me as well.~
@12254 = ~Yes, you are. But I'm not in the mood to talk about it.~
@12255 = ~Then I apologize for my inquisitive behavior.~
@12256 = ~I am sorry to hear. It must have been a traumatic experience.~
@12257 = ~It was. The loss of Gorion had a great impact on my life. Fortunately I was able to stop Sarevok's plans in the end and avenge Gorion's death.~
@12258 = ~Not at all. His actions gave me the chance to break out of the monotony of Candlekeep and follow my own path.~
@12259 = ~That's right. But then again without his interference I'd still be sitting in Candlekeep, doing nothing but the same routine day after day.~
@12260 = ~Yes, it was. I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it.~
@12261 = ~The incident caused you much pain, but it also forced you take responsibility for your own life and set you on the path you have been walking up until now.~
@12262 = ~You may have followed a path, but I am not certain whether it was your own.~
@12263 = ~Taking a practical view on your life is not the worst thing to do.~
@12264 = ~You have accomplished great things by destroying your sibling and undoing the chaos he brought. That is what you will be remembered for, regardless of your motives behind it.~
@12265 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, I have watched you most carefully after your horrible treatment by Irenicus and I am impressed that you have not given up despite your current state.~
@12266 = ~Thank you. But honestly I'm not sure if I can go on like this much longer.~
@12267 = ~Do I have another choice?~
@12268 = ~I'm really not in the mood to discuss my current predicament with you.~
@12269 = ~As you wish. It is not my intention to trouble you further with my questions.~
@12270 = ~We have been travelling together for some time already. You have overcome many obstacles, even though the odds did not favor you all the time.~
@12271 = ~Your will to live on is much stronger than you admit to yourself.~
@12272 = ~Not really. But in the time we have been travelling together I have witnessed your strong will to live on, even though the odds did not favor you all the time.~
@12273 = ~Even with the loss of your soul you have come far. I am certain that you will catch up with Irenicus sooner or later and overcome this trial as well.~
@12274 = ~Don't be so down. We've been through worse situations. Okay, not really. But together we can catch up with Irenicus and make him pay.~
@12275 = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, I share your grief about the loss of your soul.~
@12276 = ~Although I am hesitant to speak about it, I can understand your current predicament better than you might think.~
@12277 = ~Really? Tell me more!~
@12278 = ~Thanks, but I don't want to hear more about it right now.~
@12279 = ~As you wish.~
@12280 = ~I have lost parts of my spiritual essence as well. It happened long ago, but the effect is still as prevalent as back then.~
@12281 = ~Why didn't you mention it before?~
@12282 = ~How did that happen?~
@12283 = ~It is not my way to freely talk about matters that might be used against me. But the situation changed after you lost your soul as well.~
@12284 = ~I am loath to tell you specifics. It happened centuries ago when I walked the prime material plane after a long time of absence.~
@12285 = ~I was ambushed by a drow party at night. Their attack came seemingly out of nowhere and was carried out with utmost precision. Even though I was able to set up my defences, the enemy had the means to penetrate them without difficulties. The fight was decided in a matter of seconds.~
@12286 = ~My opponents knew exactly who I was and what to expect from me. My suspicions were confirmed later by my captor.~
@12287 = ~Who was able to catch you so easily?~
@12288 = ~You are talking about Tathas Melarn, aren't you?~
@12289 = ~I will not tell you the name of my captor, to avoid putting you at unnecessary risk.~
@12290 = ~My captor performed a dark ritual that ripped a part of my spiritual essence out and locked it away into a magical crystal.~
@12291 = ~Yes, I am. He is apparently a collector of sorts, specialized in exotic and powerful beings that he manages to bring under his control.~
@12292 = ~He performed a dark ritual that ripped a part of my spiritual essence out and locked it away into a magical crystal.~
@12293 = ~I was able to flee eventually, but in my weakened state I was an easy target for the rakshasa who crossed my path several years ago.~
@12294 = ~Even now I can feel the loss of my soul as intense as at the moment it was forcibly removed.~
@12295 = ~And I thought your binding to the lamp is bad enough. Compared to your predicament, my current state doesn't sound so bad anymore.~
@12296 = ~So your situation is even worse than my own? I'm sorry to hear.~
@12297 = ~It is bad, but I have learned to be patient. Everything will be solved sooner or later as long as you do not give up.~
@12298 = ~I have been thinking about recent events lately. If Irenicus made a deal with the drow, his plans must involve much more than stealing your divine soul.~
@12299 = ~You may be right. He mentioned something about settling an old score.~
@12300 = ~Dealing with drow is always dangerous. Maybe he needs them because he isn't as powerful as he wants us to believe.~
@12301 = ~I don't know and I don't want to waste my time with speculations that lead to nothing.~
@12302 = ~It is your decision. But I want to point out that you have been caught in his traps once. Do not make the same mistake a second time.~
@12303 = ~He might have been in the past, but right now he has access to your portion of Bhaal's divine essence in addition to his own power.~
@12304 = ~His plans worked out frighteningly accurate, despite some improvisations.~
@12305 = ~Revenge is a strong motivating factor. He took high risks by capturing you and even allowed himself to be captured by the Cowled Wizards.~
@12306 = ~His desire for vengeance must be great indeed to take such risks. Even though not all went according to his plans, he appears to have reached his goal.~
@12307 = ~Your escape however was unexpected. I wonder if it has any impact on his current plans?~
@12308 = ~He acted very arrogantly in my presence. I don't think he wastes any thoughts on me at all.~
@12309 = ~If he continues his plans as carefully as in the past, I have to expect another trap. I must proceed carefully.~
@12310 = ~Right now I don't care what he plans. All I can think of is getting my soul back.~
@12311 = ~Arrogance can cloud a person's judgement.~
@12312 = ~He underestimated you in your final confrontation in Spellhold, but at that time we had help from the prison's inmates.~
@12313 = ~Now we are on our own and Irenicus knows this. It might give us an advantage in our next confrontation.~
@12314 = ~I agree that his plans were laid out very carefully, but he is also convinced of his superiority. We can use this overconfidence of his to our advantage.~
@12315 = ~Do not let desperation lead your actions. An opponent as powerful as him will have ways to stop you even if you manage to surprise him.~
@12316 = ~I trust your judgment though and will follow your lead wherever you go. I am hopeful that together we will succeed in the end.~
@12317 = ~I can imagine that you are wondering about my past in the presence of the drow sorcerer Tathas Melarn.~
@12318 = ~He might have mentioned bits and pieces about me in his dealings with you. But I am certain that he told you nothing about how I was able to flee from his immediate grasp.~
@12319 = ~No he hasn't. Please tell me more!~
@12320 = ~Another story about you? I'm not interested.~
@12321 = ~I have told you that the drow sorcerer Tathas Melarn captured me and locked parts of my spiritual essence away. I have not told you, however, how I was able to flee from his immediate grasp.~
@12322 = ~Please tell me more!~
@12323 = ~I am disappointed by your lack of interest, but I will comply with your wishes.~
@12324 = ~We genies are used to being in service to powerful mortals for a limited span of time. In many cases both sides benefit from the relation.~
@12325 = ~In my case with the drow sorcerer it was different. He forced me into servitude without giving me a chance to negotiate any form of contract.~
@12326 = ~By sealing away portions of my spiritual essence I was not in a position to complain anymore.~
@12327 = ~So you had to perform all his tasks unconditionally?~
@12328 = ~Yes, and many of his tasks went against my basic nature.~
@12329 = ~I do not want to burden you with gruesome details, but in that time I learned the daily horror of surviving in a society that is dominated by a ruthless religion and based on power play of the worst kind.~
@12330 = ~It is a bitter irony that the worst excesses of that society saved me and many others in the end.~
@12331 = ~What happened?~
@12332 = ~My former master was an expert in espionage and infiltration. His talents allowed him to assimilate smaller houses without significant losses and at the same time he managed to keep the more dangerous rivals at bay.~
@12333 = ~His latest campaign went not as smoothly as he calculated. Despite his precautions he was ambushed and captured by a rival house. Fearful of his might, they attempted to cut off his connection to the magical weave. They failed, but for a short moment all magical connections were severed, including the links to his thralls.~
@12334 = ~We took advantage of that short moment of freedom and removed our magical collars that kept us under control.~
@12335 = ~Not all of us managed to escape however. His magic returned very quickly and we had no time to stay and help the remaining slaves.~
@12336 = ~Even though I was able to flee, my spiritual essence did not return to me. I was condemned to stay on the prime material plane all the long years, weakened and vulnerable.~
@12337 = ~Did you try to reclaim your essence?~
@12338 = ~Now I understand why you were captured so easily by the rakshasa.~
@12339 = ~I have seriously considered it. I refrained from it in the end since my chances of success were minimal.~
@12340 = ~Instead I studied alternate methods to overcome my weakened state. I travelled from one place to another, following even the vaguest hints.~
@12341 = ~About thirty years ago I must have drawn the attention of a certain group of rakshasa. They followed me undetected, and studied me and my weaknesses before they took the initiative.~
@12342 = ~Unable to retreat to the Plane of Air and with many of my powers sealed away, I was an easy prey for their priests.~
@12343 = ~That was some story. The life of a genie is not as easy as I thought.~
@12344 = ~You have suffered a long time. No wonder you are so gloomy all the time.~
@12345 = ~I wish I could do more to help you.~
@12346 = ~My current plight is just another trial in life I have to endure.~
@12347 = ~You have helped me more than you can imagine by reclaiming my soulcage from Tathas Melarn. Even though I have not the power to break its seal at the moment, I can finally see a glimpse of hope.~
@12348 = ~I have learned to be patient in past ages. Whether it takes me another three or three hundred centuries, I will survive in one way or another. Unlike for you mortals, time is of little importance for my kind.~
@12349 = ~Have you ever met one of my kind outside of ritual bindings?~
@12350 = ~I had some dealings with the dao genies in Trademeet.~
@12351 = ~I think I had, but I don't remember where.~
@12352 = ~I don't think so.~
@12353 = ~No, and I don't care.~
@12354 = ~That is unfortunate, but I do not want to engage you in conversation against your will.~
@12355 = ~I have realized that many mortals do not distinguish between the different clans of genies. The djinn, dao or efreet for example.~
@12356 = ~It is a very important distinction for us and we do not take kindly that kind of generalization. You might be similarly offended if we were throwing humans, elves, duergar and orcs together.~
@12357 = ~That's right. I have to admit that I don't know anything about it either.~
@12358 = ~That's right. I have heard the terms djinn, dao or efreet before, but nothing specific.~
@12359 = ~That's right. I however have learned much about your kind and can understand why you don't feel comfortable when people aren't able to tell djinn and dao apart.~
@12360 = ~It doesn't really matter as far as I'm concerned. But others might be offended.~
@12361 = ~You do not need to be embarrassed. We rarely give outsiders an insight into our social structures.~
@12362 = ~The few bits and pieces known to men are most likely accumulated over generations of wizards dealing with our kind.~
@12363 = ~You continue to surprise me, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. That knowledge is surely not easy to come by for outsiders.~
@12364 = ~I am a djinni, as you have surely realized by now. Our kind is born out of the chaotic elements of air.~
@12365 = ~We are not the only clan of genies in the planes however. Our mortal enemies, the dao and efreets, are there as well. They rarely cross our paths, but when it happens it almost always results in violence.~
@12366 = ~Can't you find ways for a peaceful coexistence?~
@12367 = ~Please go on.~
@12368 = ~Do not ask for the impossible. Their existence alone is a grave offence by itself. The dao or efreets surely view our kind similarly.~
@12369 = ~I can imagine this fact is difficult for a mortal to comprehend. But this is our way.~
@12370 = ~Not all of our clans are hostile to each other. Although we do not have much contact with the marids, their kind is not unwelcome in our midst.~
@12371 = ~Marids?~
@12372 = ~Marids are genies born out of the capricious element of water. They rarely mingle with mortals however, so I can understand your ignorance.~
@12373 = ~There are other clans such as the jann, khayal or qorrash, but we either avoid their kind or maintain distant relations with them.~
@12374 = ~Very interesting. That was a unique insight into your culture.~
@12375 = ~Very interesting. Even I didn't know everything you've told me.~
@12376 = ~Thanks for sharing your knowledge with me, Afaaq.~
@12377 = ~Consider yourself fortunate, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. We usually do not tell outsiders about us as freely as I have.~
@12378 = ~I am just recalling how we first met. Much has changed since you decided to take me with you.~
@12379 = ~You have changed.~
@12380 = ~The trials in hell have given you power, but Bhaal's influence over you now is greater than ever.~
@12381 = ~So what. Power is everything. I will overcome Bhaal's influence over me eventually and become a god in my own right.~
@12382 = ~It doesn't matter. Instead of fighting the taint and becoming weaker in the process I will take advantage of it.~
@12383 = ~What does it have to do with you?~
@12384 = ~I have no desire to talk about it.~
@12385 = ~I have watched you most carefully during your trials in hell. Even the most tempting offer could not sway you to leave your chosen path. I am most impressed, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@12386 = ~It is my duty to fight evil in any form. As a paladin I can do no other.~
@12387 = ~Fighting Bhaal's evil taint is very taxing, but I have to do what is right.~
@12388 = ~The dreams are tempting sometimes, but I know in my heart that I'll lose myself in the end if I listen to them.~
@12389 = ~It might look easy from the outside, but every single moment I have to fight hard not to fall for the promises whispered in my dreams.~
@12390 = ~Thank you, but I have no desire to talk about it.~
@12391 = ~I am simply curious. As your travelling companion I have an interest in the path you are following.~
@12392 = ~You are treading a dangerous path, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Gods are not known to share their power, much less leave it in the care of others.~
@12393 = ~My people do not care much for the affairs of the gods nowadays. In our distant past however we had to deal with them in one way or another. They do not take it lightly if anyone questions their authority or stands in their way.~
@12394 = ~Even if I wanted to change my ways, it is too late now. I have walked my current path for too long already.~
@12395 = ~Don't lecture me again. I've made my decision and you can't dissuade me from it.~
@12396 = ~All I am doing is giving you food for thought. It is ultimately your decision how to act on it.~
@12397 = ~Fighting against a power you do not understand is always difficult.~
@12398 = ~That is a laudable attitude.~
@12399 = ~You have prevailed against it even in the most difficult situations, when the whole world conspired against you and even fate did not favor your chosen path. I do not see the danger that you will lose to it anytime soon.~
@12400 = ~Whether you are aware of it or not, I can already sense the duality of your soul losing its significance. Your own soul has become the dominant part of your being and Bhaal's taint is already struggling to survive.~
@12401 = ~It doesn't really feel that way. It is still taunting me and playing with my self-doubts.~
@12402 = ~That's a reassuring thought. I'm already tired fighting against it continuously.~
@12403 = ~There is nothing I would rather hear. Finally I can ease my fight against the taint a bit.~
@12404 = ~This is a dangerous attitude. The balance of your two souls is not set in stone. It is an ever changing process and Bhaal's side will never cease its efforts to pull you into darkness.~
@12405 = ~Thank you for your wise words. I will think about them in time.~
@12406 = ~It is my decision in the end how I'm living my life.~
@12407 = ~No offence, but I'd prefer to choose how to proceed on my own.~
@12408 = ~Yes, it is. And it will continue to do so until the very end. Realizing this will give you the necessary strength to continue your fight against Bhaal's taint, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@12409 = ~It is not my intention to tell you what to do, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I am sharing my thoughts with you out of friendship. It is ultimately your decision how to act on it.~
@12410 = ~I have witnessed great events unfolding before my eyes and taken part in battles that passed into legends countless ages ago, but I have yet to see a divine prophecy coming true.~
@12411 = ~How old are you anyway?~
@12412 = ~That's nice to know, but I haven't the time to discuss it.~
@12413 = ~Even so I am honored to be on your side, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, while this event unfolds.~
@12414 = ~Answering this question is more difficult than you can imagine.~
@12415 = ~Time flows differently on the planes. The nature of the planes themselves influences our own perception of time and space.~
@12416 = ~My own home, the Elemental Plane of Air, is ever chaotic, ever changing. But at the same time it does not age the same way as the prime material plane does. You can live there for ages without noticing the flow of time.~
@12417 = ~I was already old when humans became sentient. I have seen the birth of gods and their demise and taken part in battles long before your world was given a name.~
@12418 = ~Fascinating. Can you tell me more of that time?~
@12419 = ~You are surely exaggerating. No one can live forever.~
@12420 = ~I can't believe it. It boggles my mind just to think about you witnessing the birth of our world.~
@12421 = ~It is not so much beyond belief if you take into account that I am an immortal spirit born out of the chaotic elements of air.~
@12422 = ~But even I have a beginning and an end. My current form will cease to exist eventually, only to be reborn again.~
@12423 = ~So you really took part in events ages ago. Can you tell me stories of that time?~
@12424 = ~I can tell you a little. But I will not reveal too much, as some events should remain buried in the mist of time.~
@12425 = ~My first visit to your world happened over nine millennia ago in the entourage of our great leader Calim. I may talk about it later in detail if we have the time and you are willing to listen.~
@12426 = ~Before that time I served mostly as a soldier in the service of Caliph Hasib. Back then I was not the same djinni as you see before you now. I was fiercely loyal to my clan and would have given my life to defend it.~
@12427 = ~Our tasks included the defence of our strongholds and small skirmishes against rivals and the occasional intruder. It was rather peaceful compared to the turmoils of ancient times.~
@12428 = ~What turmoils are you talking about?~
@12429 = ~Can you tell me more of your time in the service of that caliph?~
@12430 = ~I was talking about the grand conflict between gods and primordials in ancient times. You may have heard about it as the Dawn War, but do not ask for details. This dark chapter of my life is better off to pass into oblivion forever.~
@12431 = ~I can tell you more about my time in the service of Caliph Hasib instead.~
@12432 = ~Yes, please do.~
@12433 = ~No, thanks. You've already told me more than I wanted to know.~
@12434 = ~My time at the court of Caliph Hasib is probably the most memorable chapter of my life.~
@12435 = ~As I have already mentioned before, we were mainly busy defending our stronghold against rivals and the occasional intruder. But there were exceptions.~
@12436 = ~At one time our scouts reported a mysterious change in the cloud formations of a certain region near our stronghold. Our unit had been chosen to investigate this matter more thoroughly.~
@12437 = ~We carefully approached the target area. All we could make out was an oddly formed cloud formation before us. Just as we decided to take a closer look, we were ambushed by a cluster of air elementals and servants.~
@12438 = ~We were unable to sense them before, as they were concealed by a magical curtain. They had already surrounded us and we had to act quickly. Our commander decided to wait and see what our opponents were up to.~
@12439 = ~His risky decision turned out to be right. We were so distracted by the perceived danger that we did not notice the true scenery before us. The magical curtain concealed a majestic castle of magical beauty, built on a plateau of clouds and mist.~
@12440 = ~The residents of that place turned out to be Cloud Giants. They knew all about us and had prepared the whole situation as some kind of test. Our decision to act calmly and wait for our opponents to make the first move told them much of our true intentions. They offered an alliance with our ruler.~
@12441 = ~Caliph Hasib was impressed by their tactical abilities as well as of our judicious way to deal with the situation and rewarded us appropriately.~
@12442 = ~What a wonderful tale.~
@12443 = ~Very long-winded, but interesting nonetheless.~
@12444 = ~Unfortunately, events such as this are only few and far between. More often than not encounters with foreigners end in violence and chaos, as I had to find out the hard way over and over.~
@12445 = ~It is your loss. But let us continue our journey.~
@12446 = ~Your path draws to a close, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@12447 = ~In the course of your journey you have gained incredible power, destroyed everyone in your path and embraced the taint of your father. Everything seems to unfold according to your wishes.~
@12448 = ~You will probably have to make the hardest decision of your life sometime soon. Looking back to the beginnings of your journey, did you ever imagine that it would come to this?~
@12449 = ~Questions such as these are never difficult to answer. I may not have known what I could become back in those days, but I always knew it would be grand.~
@12450 = ~Honestly, I didn't know what to expect. But in the course of my journey, when I gradually became aware of my true heritage, I knew what I had to do.~
@12451 = ~My life has mostly consisted of choices and consequences. This is just another choice and I will bear the consequences just as well.~
@12452 = ~I didn't imagine it in the least back then, and even today I'm not yet sure what to make of it. I'll decide when the time comes.~
@12453 = ~I don't want to answer that question just yet. What about you? What do you plan to do when our journey comes to an end?~
@12454 = ~Don't bother me again with useless questions, Afaaq.~
@12455 = ~In the course of your journey you have become stronger, more experienced and perhaps a bit wiser. You have dealt with your adversaries appropriately and fought against the dark taint of your father.~
@12456 = ~You have an opportunity at hand that has only been shared by very few mortals in history. Looking back to the beginnings of your journey, did you ever imagine that it would come to this?~
@12457 = ~I have followed my own path from the beginning and did not waver no matter how difficult the trials. Even if I didn't know about my fate back in those days, I always knew that I would follow the path of righteousness.~
@12458 = ~Honestly, I didn't know what to expect. But in the course of my journey, when I gradually became aware of my true heritage, I knew that I had to hold on to my own ideals. Otherwise I would have become Bhaal's puppet as Sarevok and all the others I had to fight.~
@12459 = ~I didn't know back then and even today I have trouble understanding it all. But I have lived every moment of my own life to the fullest and I will continue to do so until the very end.~
@12460 = ~I don't want to talk about it, Afaaq.~
@12461 = ~I am aware that I am inquiring about a very sensitive matter, especially for someone who carries such a great burden. Be assured that I will honor your privacy in the future.~
@12462 = ~Even if it was only for a short time, I have seen how you have followed the path you have taken. How you have dealt with obstacles put in your way and how you reacted to temptations offered from the outside and from within.~
@12463 = ~You have never given in or ignored the truth of what you are and who you are. All in all I have seen very mortal qualities and you can be proud of them.~
@12464 = ~And what about you? What do you plan to do when our journey comes to an end?~
@12465 = ~I have known you only for a short time, but from what I have seen you never had a choice what path to follow after giving in to Bhaal's taint. You have deceived yourself all the time even though you are nothing but a tool for higher powers.~
@12466 = ~But on the other hand, mortals have never given in to the will of others for long. Someday you might have the power to free yourself from Bhaal's influence and forge your own future.~
@12467 = ~I have travelled with you only for a short time, but I am genuinely impressed with how you have managed to resist all the temptations, be it from the outside or from within, that attempted to pull you into darkness.~
@12468 = ~You have stayed true to yourself all this time - even now, as the time prophesied by Alaundo draws near. All in all a very mortal quality, but at the same time as pure as of divine origin. You have made a lasting impression on me, even though I have seen much in my life already.~
@12469 = ~Me? I have not given much thought to this matter yet. After centuries forced to walk this plane I will surely return back home for some time.~
@12470 = ~But to be honest, I am tired of this life. I already was long before I was abused by the rakshasa or captured by the drow.~
@12471 = ~But why...~
@12472 = ~I have seen too much and suffered too much in ages past. If the time comes to bring this cycle of life to a close I will gladly accept my fate.~
@12473 = ~But now is not the time for gloomy thoughts. You have an appointment with your own fate and I do not want to delay you any further.~

@14500 = ~Hey Afaaq! Do you have any good stories to tell?~
@14501 = ~I have seen many events since I arrived on this plane and even took part in some of them. Not all were pleasant, and some should be buried in oblivion forever. However, I can give you an account of my time in the service of Caliph Hasib if you desire.~
@14502 = ~No, Afaaq. I want you to tell me a story. Something exciting or funny, or even romantic. The way you talk about your past sounds always so gloomy.~
@14503 = ~I think I understand your concern. Then let me tell you the tale of the Mystic Gardens of Almraiven.~
@14504 = ~That sounds much better. But we shouldn't keep <CHARNAME> waiting too long. I'd love to listen to your tale when we set up camp tonight.~
@14505 = ~You are right, Imoen. The tale is quite deep and requires patience as well as a sharp mind to understand all the intricacies of its underlying philosophy.~
@14506 = ~Afaaq?!~
@14507 = ~Oh, do not worry too much. You will enjoy the tale nonetheless.~
@14550 = ~Do you sometimes miss your home?~
@14551 = ~I am not yet so long away from my home plane in djinni terms. We are solitary creatures by nature. It is not unusual for a djinn to journey alone for an age or two.~
@14552 = ~Do you have something on your mind, Imoen?~
@14553 = ~No, not really. I've been thinking about my home in Candlekeep recently. About what would have happened if I had not followed <CHARNAME> when <PRO_HESHE> left with Gorion. I would certainly not have been through all this torture from Irenicus, and more.~
@14554 = ~Having regrets about past decisions is a mortal quality. You have made your choices and were able to follow them through until now. Hardship is part of the journey. It molds your character and lets you become stronger and more experienced.~
@14555 = ~I guess so. If I had stayed in Candlekeep then I would have had to flee from other Bhaalspawns eventually. I might have even ended in Saradush with all the others. A horrible thought.~
@14556 = ~That would have been one of countless paths you could have taken. Never forget that you can follow different branches at any given time. Having stayed at home would have as many possible outcomes as travelling with <CHARNAME>.~
@14557 = ~Yeah, but many times I feel as if I have little choice in what to do or where to go. Being a Bhaalspawn is pretty inconvenient at times.~
@14558 = ~Your observation is not completely wrong. Many choices are made unconsciously, and sometimes they are influenced by other forces. Especially when your heritage comes into play.~
@14559 = ~We djinn strongly believe in Fate, the grand plan of the universe that guides and sometimes forces us to follow a certain direction. But that doesn't mean you have no control over the choices you make in life. On the contrary, it is up to you which path you will take and the universe will follow suit.~
@14560 = ~That sounds really weird. But thank you anyway, Afaaq. I try to remember your words when I'm about to make another stupid choice.~

@17000 = ~Afaaq, you are obviously not from around here.  Do you care to tell me where you hail from?~
@17001 = ~My home lies far beyond the material plane, out of reach for most mortals.  However, I have lived for quite some time in Calimshan, far to the south of here.~
@17002 = ~Ah, Calimshan.  A very rich country from what I've heard. It is also a place where you can meet all kinds of people and other races.~
@17003 = ~That is correct. Calimshan has always been a very rich nation and a melting pot of many different cultures.  Although its splendor pales in comparison to the wonders of the ancient Calim Empire.~
@17004 = ~I had considered visiting that place for a time, but in the end I wound up in Athkatla instead.~
@17005 = ~It is a good place too. There are lots of opportunities for someone like me to make a good living.~
@17006 = ~You are far away from home as well.  Why did you leave it in the first place?~
@17007 = ~The answer is surprisingly simple.  There comes a time in the life of a man when he realizes that his home has become too small and confined. Instead of settling down and leading a strictly regulated life, he took the opportunity to see the world and meet interesting people.~
@17008 = ~I see.  And did you find what you were looking for?~
@17009 = ~But of course!  Cities like this are life's blood for someone of my profession. You can find your luck literally around every corner. If you have a quick wit and a winning smile, that is.~

@19501 = ~You will be MY plaything when the spell takes effect, Afaaq.~
@19502 = ~No... it cannot be... Help me, <CHARNAME>!~
@19550 = ~It must be unbearable for a proud and noble djinn to be trapped in that prison, considering that you also have to suffer the indignity to follow every foolish whim of your masters. Don't you wish to escape this prison and enjoy freedom once more?~
@19551 = ~Your concern over my well-being is touching, wizard.~
@19552 = ~My current plight is just a temporary condition. I can allow myself to be patient, since time is of no real consequence for my kind.~

@19554 = ~I have no doubt about your willingness to help me. However, Red Wizards are not known for their generosity.~
@19555 = ~Well, of course I'm not doing it purely out of the goodness of my heart. All I desire is a small favor that should easily be within your power. What say you?~
@19556 = ~You are not the first wizard of your order I have the misfortune to deal with. But unlike your brothers in Thay you are especially easy to read.~
@19557 = ~My previous masters forced me to perform unimaginably cruel and hideous tasks. But they all were well aware of the consequences of their actions. I am not so sure in your case. I would rather suffer another millennium in their clutches than being bound to grant you even the smallest of favors imaginable.~
@19558 = ~(How dare you!) Ahem, you wound me deeply, Afaaq. Think about it some more. I'm sure you will see the advantages of my offer. (As do I for myself.)~
@19600 = ~Afaaq, please satisfy my curiosity. What was your life before your unfortunate encounters on the prime material plane?~
@19601 = ~I am certain that even the most insignificant tale from my past would vastly exceed your imagination, wizard.~
@19602 = ~Oh, do I hear a hint of sadness in your voice? Or is it regret? Your past must have been glorious indeed.~
@19603 = ~Our past is an important part of us. It shapes us and prepares for events that have not yet come to pass. Joy and sadness, anticipation and regret are all part of life. I would not have it otherwise.~
@19604 = ~I have noticed you are exceptionally reticent when it comes to your own past, wizard. Do you regret past decisions?~
@19605 = ~What nonsense! I have accomplished more than the ragtag party I'm pleasing with my presence would experience in a lifetime. My current endeavor will be just as fruitful in the end. (Even if those monkeys in Thay refuse to see it yet.)~
@19650 = ~Afaaq, I would have a word with you. Alone.~
@19651 = ~I am sure you would. Although my anticipation of this conversation is limited.~
@19652 = ~Silence! This is very important (to me).~
@19653 = ~Do you remember our first conversation? I promised to help you breaking the enchantment that keeps you chained to the lamp.~
@19654 = ~I know your kind appreciates gems, magical items or opulent meals. My family is quite affluent. I can provide you with wealth beyond your wildest dreams. All I desire is a small service of you in return. What is your decision?~
@19655 = ~You think yourself clever, but the desperation in your words is poorly veiled. Even if I did not have the experience of countless lifetimes of you mortals, I would be wary of your intent. Others of my race may be more tolerant in this regard, but I am not.~
@19656 = ~My service will never be available for your kind. I do not do this out of malice or selfishness, but rather to protect you and everyone else from the mistakes that will inevitably be the result of your actions. Do not ask me of it again.~
@19657 = ~So you refuse a helping hand and the opportunity to gain wealth beyond measure at the same time? You are more a fool than I expected. It is your loss, djinn. (But don't think I will give up so easily.)~
@19658 = ~So you refuse the opportunity to gain wealth beyond measure? You are more a fool than I expected. It is your loss, djinn.~
@19659 = ~In addition I can offer you riches beyond your dreams. My family is quite affluent. I know your kind appreciates gems, magical items or opulent meals. All I desire is a small service of you in return. What is your decision?~
@19700 = ~I can not believe the foolishness of that wizard. He should have known that artifacts like these are protected against half-hearted attempts to break their enchantments.~
@19701 = ~He could have easily imprisoned everyone including you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, by his foolish actions. I hope you have a way to free him from his predicament, because he will not have the power to do it by himself anymore.~
@19702 = ~I guess he has learned his lesson now. Would a Freedom spell release him from his imprisonment?~
@19703 = ~I think he has learned his lesson now. How exactly can I release him from his predicament?~
@19704 = ~That fool is more trouble than he's worth it. Let him rot in hell, for all I care.~
@19705 = ~Yes, I think it would. But it has to be cast near the place of his imprisonment to be effective. I hope you have a spell like that ready.~
@19706 = ~Only a Freedom spell will release the wizard from his prison. But it has to be used near the place of his imprisonment to be effective. I hope you have a way to cast this spell.~
@19707 = ~I can not blame you if you want to leave him where he is. But if you change your mind, a Freedom spell will probably release him from his prison. It has to be cast near the place of his imprisonment to be effective, however.~
@19708 = ~Can't you grant me the wish to free Edwin from his state?~
@19709 = ~Yes, I can grant you a wish to release someone from imprisonment. However, I can do it only a single time. Please think carefully before you make use of my offer.~
@19750 = ~It is about time that you came to my rescue. I...I thought I had to waste one of my own spells to free myself. (How very clever of me.)~
@19751 = ~Do you still need my superior intellect, <CHARNAME>?~
@19752 = ~Of course. I'm sure you won't try anything stupid like that again.~
@19753 = ~Not at the moment. I will have to think about your careless actions for a while.~
@19754 = ~What?! After all you have done, Edwin? You should be lucky that I cared enough to free you from your predicament.~
@19755 = ~Fine, I didn't care for your presence anyway. Good riddance!~
@19756 = ~Not at the moment. I will have to think about your careless actions for a while. I'll send you back to the pocket plane.~
@19757 = ~Not at the moment. I will have to think about your careless actions for a while. Just wait here for a while.~

@21003 = ~Something does not feel right. I urge you to be very careful, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@21004 = ~That is a terrible fate, to be tormented endlessly by the drow without hope of deliverance. If we were not on a mission of secrecy, I would gladly free the djinni from his bonds.~

@60083 = ~Afaaq's close connection to the Elemental Plane of Air enables him to raise and control whirlwinds. After regaining his full power, he is able to create whirlwinds anywhere within sight. Each whirlwind causes damage and occasional blindness to any hostile creature in close vicinity.

Since whirlwinds are an extension of the djinni himself, he can observe his surroundings through the whirlwinds. Thus moving them out of sight doesn't make him lose control over them. The whirlwinds stay active for one turn at level 15 or less. Each additional character level adds one more round to the whirlwind's lifetime. If the djinni dies, loses his form or is affected by certain disabling effects even for a moment, the whirlwind will dissipate immediately.~
@60084 = ~This spell enables Afaaq to move at about double his normal movement rate. He also gains a -2 initiative bonus, and receives an extra attack per round. The effect will stay active for five turns.

// Afaaq's Epilogues
@64090 = ~Afaaq continued his journey with <CHARNAME> which took them halfway across Faerûn and back. They defeated raiding parties of sahuagin on the western borders of Tethyr and pushed back an invasion of frost giants threatening Luskan and the surrounding settlements.

Eventually Afaaq parted with <CHARNAME> and returned to his home on the Elemental Plane of Air at long last where he hoped to live a quiet life. But news of his deeds had even reached the ears of the Grand Caliph who offered him a position as advisor in mortal affairs at the Court of Ice and Steel.

However, as much as his time allows it, he takes the chance and travels across Faerûn in search of his kinsmen still waiting to be released from their imprisonments.~

@70001 = ~Free Edwin from his imprisonment

Edwin's attempt to steal Afaaq's lamp from me backfired and resulted only in his imprisonment. According to Afaaq, only a Freedom spell, cast in the vicinity of Edwin's imprisonment, may release him from his predicament. He also offered me to use his Limited Wish ability to accomplish this task.~

I was able to release Edwin from his magical prison. He was as grateful as I expected from him. Hopefully he learned from his mistakes and will refrain from doing such careless actions in the future.~
