**Contents**
* The djinni Afaaq who acts as your "seventh party member"

* Up to five new interesting quests

* Several easter eggs


## Mod Components

1. The main component comes in two flavors:

  **Full Version:** (recommended) This component installs the djinni Afaaq together with quests, new maps, lots of interjections, commentaries and banters with the protagonist as well as all Bioware/Beamdog NPCs.

  **Light Version:** This component installs a stripped down version of the mod consisting only of the djinni Afaaq and his magical lamp. Choose this if you merely want additional fighting power in your adventures.

2. **IWD:EE Version:** This component is more or less the same as the *Light Version*, but can be installed in *Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition*. It provides a stripped down version of the mod consisting of the djinni Afaaq, his magical lamp and a simple storyline to spice up the adventure.

3. **Banter accelerator:** (Full Version only) Lets you control how often a conversation should be triggered by the djinni. Possible values range from 15 min. to 120 min. (Default is 60 minutes).
   *Note: Only conversations between the djinni and the protagonist are affected.*

4. **Remove Afaaq's banter soundtrack:** (Full Version only) By default, a short oriental soundtrack will be played back whenever the djinni starts a conversation with the protagonist. This component disables the soundtrack.

5. **Alternate djinni portrait by Ulb:** Choose this component if you want to replace the default portrait of the djinni Afaaq by an alternate version. ([Preview](https://argent77.github.io/DjinniCompanion/images/AfaaqAlternate.jpg))

6. **Disable IWD:EE Quest:** (IWD:EE Version only) The quest, which is attached to the presence of the djinni in the party, includes a number of challenging battles. Choose this component if you want to skip this quest entirely.

7. **Add Infinity Animation creatures:** (Full Version only) This component will be triggered only if the mod "Infinity Animations" and its subcomponent "Distinctive Genies" have been installed. It replaces a couple of creature animations with more natural looking versions.


## Details

Afaaq is a djinni – a genie of the Elemental Plane of Air. He is very old even in genie terms. The numerous events he witnessed in his long life have left their marks on his personality. He appears somewhat reserved and radiates a melancholic, sometimes even gloomy aura. Afaaq is more serious than others of his kind and tends to talk in a rather long-winded and convoluted way. He respects wisdom and open-mindedness, but will also tolerate foolhardy behavior to a certain degree. Everything else he can tell you by himself.

When you first meet him, he is equipped with his favorite enchanted scimitar, has a small variety of spells and a couple of unusual innate abilities. The djinni gains experience much like a party member would do and levels up automatically. Depending on the choices you make during the course of the game, he may become even more useful later.

**Initial Statistics**
* Class: Fighter/Mage at level 10/11
* Alignment: Chaotic Good
* Strength: 15
* Dexterity: 16
* Constitution: 13
* Intelligence: 15
* Wisdom: 16
* Charisma: 11

If you want to know more, simply talk to him when he is around or in his magical lamp. He will be happy to answer most of your questions in detail.
